<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Will teams be allowed to use Arduinos / prototyping boards this year?  <br>
1b.  If they are allowed, are there restrictions as to their use (interfacing with a sensor and reporting results back to the CDIM, or only decorative use such as quickly cycling LEDs to save power instead of just hooking all the LEDs directly to the battery and/or displaying an image on an LED matrix, which also requires rapid LED cycling).<br>
<br>
The ability to incorporate Electrical Engineering more into the curriculum would be fantastic.  It's understood the Core Device Interface Module can perform many of these functions, but for something which requires rapid updates, it would be highly preferable to offload this away from the phone and the devices running the robot.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does &lt;RE06&gt; exclude supplementary controller boards (ex: Arduino) and/or Custom/DIY Sensors?<br>
<br>
<br>
Would a digital volt meter be allowed on the robot? (example: http://www.powerwerx.com/batteries-chargers/panel-mount-digital-volt-meter-12vdc.html )<br>
<br>
A: No, per &lt;RE06&gt;d. “Other electronics are not allowed.” The only allowed additional electronics by &lt;RE06&gt; are light sources (see also &lt;RE03&gt;g.), manufactured sensors and the HiTechnic NXT1060 multiplexor, and video recording devices (see also &lt;RE03&gt;f.); in addition, manufactured sensors must connect directly to the Core Device Interface Module or to the Core Legacy Module either directly or through a HiTechnic NTX1060 multiplexor and may not connect directly to robot power or to USB. Note that this rule also precludes the use of Legacy prototype boards, microcontroller boards, and custom sensors.<br>
<br>
Communicating with additional electronics is likely to require drivers or other software support which is not available or which may not be compatible with the Robot Controller software used in this year's game. Although not allowed for this year's game, GDC will evaluate software and driver availability and compatibility to determine what additional electronics can be supported in future games.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there provisions in the rules that allow us to generate custom sensors as was indicated when the new control system was being released?  If so, what rule allows the use of momentary switches as limit switches and touch sensors?  Would the same be used for potentiometers as rotational sensors?<br>
<br>
A: No, per &lt;RE06&gt;b. custom sensors are not allowed; compatible sensors include manufactured sensors that are connected directly to the Core Device Interface Module or to the Core Legacy Module either directly or through a HiTechnic NTX1060 multiplexor.<br>
<br>
Simple manufactured devices may be considered sensors as long as they are compatible with the Core Device Interface Module; thus a simple switch is an allowed sensor. Note that per &lt;RE06&gt;d. you may not add any other electronics to the switch. If required, per &lt;RE05&gt;g. “sensor wires and their connectors may be extended, modified, custom made, or COTS” to connect to the Core Device Interface Module.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are LIDAR Sensors allowed?<br>
They do use focused emitted light; but, so do the reflective light sensors.<br>
I see some teams used them last year and were allowed if there power level was below a certain level<br>
<br>
A: No, per &lt;R06&gt;a. LIDAR is both a laser and a focused/directed light source and is thus not allowed.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are motor controller power lines classified as "battery" or "motor" wires for AWG?<br>
<br>
<br>
Does &lt;RE03&gt;d mean power for legacy motor controllers have to connect direct to the Power Control Module (no chaining)?<br>
This would force a lot of home run wiring and making custom crimped Power Pole cables<br>
<br>
A: Power connections to Core Devices must connect directly to the Core Power Distribution Module; this module acts as a power splitter for the battery thus these connections:<br>
<br>
<br>
 must be connected directly to the Core Power Distribution Module per &lt;RE05&gt;e. and may not be chained<br>
 should be considered Battery wires and per &lt;RE05&gt;g.i. must be 16 AWG or larger<br>
 may use power splitters per &lt;RE05&gt;f.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are vision senors and/or using the phone camera allowed?  <br>
How does that fit with the &lt;RE06&gt; c?<br>
<br>
A: Yes, you are free to use the phone camera as a sensor; other vision sensors are allowed if they are compatible manufactured sensors that are connected directly to the Core Device Interface Module or to the Core Legacy Module either directly or through a HiTechnic NTX1060 multiplexor. Note that per &lt;RE06&gt;c. “Video recording devices (GoPro or similar) are allowed providing they are used only for non-functional post match entertainment” and thus these devices may not be used as a sensor as they may not be connected to USB (&lt;RE06&gt;c.) or to power (&lt;RE04&gt;f.).</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When wiring this year's robots, will teams still need to have a separate Power switch connected between the battery and the Core Power Distribution module? Or will the power switch on the Distribution Module itself serve as the main power switch this year?<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;RE03 c.&gt; States the we are allowed to use a second power switch before the PDM. Are we allowed to use any type of Toggle or Rocker Switch, or does it need to match last years switch? When will the Wiring Guide be released?<br>
<br>
A: Standalone power switches are optional but are strongly recommended; if used, per &lt;RG04&gt;a. the standalone power switch must be either “TETRIX (part #W39129) or MATRIX (part# 50-00300).”<br>
<br>
FIRST strongly recommends using a standalone main power switch both to make it easy for field personnel to find as well as to protect robot wiring from interference. Per &lt;RG04&gt; and &lt;RE03&gt;c., you may use either a single standalone main power switch or the switch on the Core Power Distribution Module. Note, however, that using the switch on the Core Power Distribution Module and placing it so that it is readily accessible to field personnel may expose wiring connected to the Core Power Distribution Module to interference from other robots or field elements.<br>
<br>
The FTC Wiring guide is available through  along with many other team resources; it is currently last year's wiring guide but will be updated soon with specific details for the new control system. Although some of the information is outdated (you should ignore references to the LEGO NXT and the Samantha module) the bulk of the guide will be useful in constructing a reliable robot.<br>
<br>
The FIRST ResQ Robot Wiring Guide is now released! Get yours now at [URL="http://firstinspires.org/node/5181"]2014-2016 Robot Wiring Guide (http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc/team-resources).</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsunami</div><div class="date">09-26-2015, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To prevent a total system shut down if their is an electrical issue during a match (current setup has one main fuse near battery), are distribution panels that allow each circuit to be on their own fuse allowed? example RIGrunner 4005 from Powerwerx: http://www.powerwerx.com/powerpole-power-distribution/rigrunner-4005.html<br>
<br>
By using this system, if there were a short in one of the circuits, than only that "branch" of sub circuits would be disabled. Allowing for the robot to still have some mobility and opportunity to continue to compete during a match.<br>
<br>
According to the manual, power distribution splitters are allowed (&lt;RE05&gt;f). Just wanted to check that a "fused" splitter is allowed.<br>
<br>
A: Yes, per &lt;RE05&gt;f. splitters with or without fuses are allowed.<br>
<br>
Splitters may either be COTS/team constructed wire splitters (per &lt;RE05&gt;g. they must be at least 16 AWG) or purchased COTS passive power-distribution boxes such as the one that you have referenced; COTS passive power-distribution boxes may not contain switches or any other electronic components other than fuses. Splitters with fuses must have fuses configured so that they meet &lt;RE03&gt;e. such that all fuses are less than or equal to any fuses in line that are closer to the battery. Per manufacturer specification, the battery or Core Power Distribution Module must be fused with at most a 20 A fuse although you may use a fuse with a smaller current rating if desired.</div></div><hr>

<br>
1.Does this mean we can use any servo that meets the specs of modern robotics servo controller?<br>
<br>
2.Is the HiTechnic servo controller still limited to only standard and quarter scale?<br>
<br>
A1. Yes, any servo that meets the electrical specifications of the servo controller may be used.  Make sure to pay attention to the stall current ratings.  Additionally, &lt;RE02&gt; prohibits modification of the internals of the servos.<br>
A2. There is no limit based on the physical sizes of the servos. Both the Legacy HiTechnic and newer Modern Robotics servo controllers have the same 5 amp total current limit for servos connected to the controllers.</div></div><hr>

A: Yes, the Core Power Distribution Module is required per &lt;RE01&gt;.  It is the only allowed connection point for the USB connection from the Android device on the robot.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">10-02-2015, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are new to FTC and it occurred to me that the VEX 393 motors (which are legal) are actually continuous rotation servos when used with the VEX motor controller. I just want to get an official clarification that we can use these in that way. In other words, we would be able to use a total of 20 VEX 393 motors (8 without the motor controllers and 12 with them-making them servos). Is that a correct understanding?  If you need or would like further details on the VEX motor controllers, you can see it here: http://www.robotmesh.com/vex-robotics/motors-and-gears/vex-motor-controller-29<br>
<br>
A: No. The Vex 393 motor is allowed only when connected to its companion Vex Motor Controller and only when controlled by a Servo Controller (per &lt;RE04&gt;) Further, &lt;RE04&gt; clearly identifies that the Vex motor is counted against the DC motor count.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Thanks!!<br>
<br>
- FTC Team #6389 - The Lazybotts<br>
<br>
A: Yes. A slip ring is a type of electrical connector.  Per &lt;RE06&gt;.g, wires and connectors my be extended, modified, custom made, or COTS.  Care should be taken to ensure appropriate wire gauge and insulation of contacts.</div></div><hr>

<br>
https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334<br>
<br>
This seems like a "manufactured sensor" that will plug into the Core Device Interface Module once the header and leads are soldered onto the board. That is all explicitly allowed, but I still would be a lot more comfortable with an official approval on this sensor.<br>
<br>
A: In general, it is not possible for the GDC to rule on the legality of all sensors. In this particular case, yes, this sensor appears to be an example of manufactured sensor as allowed via &lt;RE06&gt;.b.i</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">10-04-2015, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br>
<br>
We've got several questions regarding the legality of interfacing with various types of sensors using the new control system. <br>
<br>
1) Is it now legal to use a LEGO Mindstorms NXT sensor with a spliced LEGO connector cable if it interfaces directly with the Core Device Interface Module? These could be considered "sensors from any manufacturer" as per &lt;RE06&gt;bi, but would this be in violation of the ruling on "legacy sensors" in &lt;RE06&gt;bii?  <br>
<br>
2a) Is it legal to use passive components in conjunction with sensor connectors, such as filter capacitors (necessary for using many IR rangefinders), or resistors (for creating voltage dividers to power lower-voltage sensors)? We feel that this could be covered under &lt;RE05&gt;g, as these components could be physically integrated into a sensor's connector, which we are free to modify. Since many manufactured sensors call for these components as part of the sensor's spec, could they be considered part of the manufactured sensor itself in that case? <br>
<br>
2b) Is it legal to connect a level shifter such as https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009 between a legal manufactured sensor and the Core Device Interface Module? Many manufactured sensors require 3.3v power and signal, which the Core Device Module cannot provide without one of these shifters. We believe these could also reasonably be considered part of the "connector", which we are free to modify per &lt;RE05&gt;g. <br>
<br>
3) Would an integrated sensor package that includes a programmable microcontroller, such as https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10736, be considered a legal "manufactured sensor"? There are many more sensors beyond this that feature integrated microcontroller units with varying degrees of programmability. This includes practically any sensor that interfaces over I2C, such as some Modern Robotics sensors. Could we have some more clarification on what constitutes a legal "manufactured sensor"? <br>
<br>
Thank you very much!<br>
FTC 4029<br>
<br>
A1: No. LEGO NXT Sensors may only be connected to the Legacy Module per &lt;RE06&gt;.b.ii. The Legacy NXT sensors require non-standard I2C support (as provided by the Core Legacy Module)<br>
<br>
A2: Yes. Passive components, as required by sensor manufacturers are allowed.<br>
<br>
A3: No. &lt;RE06&gt;.e.iii limits power for allowed sensors to come from either the Core Device Interface or the Core Legacy Module.<br>
<br>
A4: No.  Sensors combined with programmable systems are not allowed with year.</div></div><hr>

Would this be allowed?<br>
<br>
Using the provided com.qualcomm.robotcore.hardware I2cController interface class, it appears that we can easily obtain the information from the Gyro by writing a simple API/Driver. Would this be allowed?<br>

<br>
With the shift to the new hardware, is it acceptable to wire 2 motors to a single channel of Modern Robotics Motor Controller?<br>
<br>
A: Yes.  It is acceptable to wire up to 2 motors in parallel to be driven by a single motor controller.  Care should be taken during the electrical design process to avoid overloading the motor controller.  The internal thermal breaker takes significant time to cool and reset once tripped.</div></div><hr>

The encoders sold by Tetrix are expensive, and we have found them in the past to be quite fragile and somewhat lacking in reliability.  It seems there are several other encoders out there that would be less expensive, more rugged, and compatible with the motor controllers.<br>
<br>
A: Encoders compatible with the Modern Robotics Motor Controllers and Legacy HiTechnic are allowed.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">10-26-2015, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In previous seasons, teams had electrical troubles when their power was daisy-chained through the HiTechnic motor and servo controllers.  This is because when a lot of current was drawn by a motor (e.g., if it was stalled, or changing direction, etc.), the large current passing through the small trace on the printed circuit board inside the controllers resulted in a downstream voltage drop which could affect the electronics.  The FTC Robot Wiring Guide, released by FIRST, specifically identified this as a problem and proposed the solution of using external power distribution terminal/splitter/network which bypasses power being distributed through the controller's printed circuit board traces.  See for example, page 18. of the FTC Robot Wiring Guide.  http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robotics_Programs/FTC/Team_Resources/FTC_Robot_Wiring_Guide.pdf<br>
<br>
This year, the game manual states that we must route all power through the new Power Distribution Module.  This essentially requires that ALL power now go through traces on the Module's printed circuit board, which again can result in the same problem identified in the FTC Robot Wiring Guide.<br>
<br>
So, our question is, may we use an external power distribution terminal/splitter/network as suggested in the FTC Robot Wiring Guide instead of or in addition to the power distribution option in the Power Distribution Module?  Please consider that a lot of time and trouble was spent by FIRST in making the FTC Robot Wiring Guide to address previous chronic power distribution problems, and we humbly suggest that the recommendations in that document be at least permitted as an option for teams concerned about the same issues.<br>
<br>
A: Power splitters are explicitly allowed per rule &lt;RE05&gt;.f.  They may only be used downstream from the Core Power Distribution module ... i.e. the battery must connect to the Power Distribution module with nothing more than a (recommended) single power switch between.</div></div><hr>

<br>
This response, while welcomed by our team, caused us to notice that there is a conflict between Rules RE03 which only allows the use of the 9.6v Matrix battery pack when using legacy Matrix controllers, and RE04 which constrains which "Matrix" motors can be used based on whether a "Matrix" 12v or 9.6v battery pack is used.<br>
<br>
Again, our team welcomes the flexibility to use optional "approved" motors, however, there does seem to be a need for additional clarification to prevent potential issues at events, as one rule (RE04) lists allowable Matrix Only motors based on two different power supplies, and the other rule (RE03) only allows the 9.6v power source, effectively eliminating the option for multiple motor choices. <br>
<br>
Additional question on the same topic: With Legacy Matrix Controllers (2) and a single Legacy 9.6v battery pack, would it be acceptable to use the newer 12v Matrix, and/or Tetrix, and/or AndyMark "approved" motors if the team understood and accepted that the motors would be under-powered?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for your responses and again for the GDC's continued support of our efforts.<br>
<br>
A: Matrix has introduced a new line of motors that are 12V  tolerant. These motors may be used with Legacy HiTechnic or Modern Robotics motor controllers.  Additionally, they may be used with Legacy Matrix Controllers when a 12V Matrix Battery pack is used.  9.6v Matrix Motors may only be used with Legacy Matrix controllers with a 9.6v battery pack.</div></div><hr>

I was hoping to get a clarification to the response to Post #33.<br>

The post asks "At least one seller of servos offers one or more servos for sale in 90° stock rotation, 180° modified rotation, or continuous rotation, which is selected when ordering the servo. May teams purchase either a 180 degree or a continuous rotation version and use either one as long as the team does not make any changes to the servo which violates RE02 or any other rule?"<br>
<br>
Response was "No. Modifications of servos that are done post-manufacturer are not allowed per &lt;RE02&gt;".  <br>
<br>
However, the HS-485HB 180 degree servo (sold as part of the Tetrix/Pitsco kit of parts) is one of the those servos.  We are confused as the status of the servo.  Is it no longer allowed?  Does it have to be purchased only from Tetrix? <br>
<br>
As always, thanks for your response and all you do for FTC Robotics Teams!<br>
<br>
A: The question in post #33 asks specifically about servos that are modified by the seller to add new functionality.  Servos modified by the seller are not allowed.  All compatible servos that are in original manufactured condition, from any seller are allowed per &lt;RE04&gt;</div></div><hr>

A: &lt;RE02&gt; is about modifying motors/servos. The product mentioned is an assembly of two products, a servo and a gearbox.  Since the servo is not modified by the seller and is compatible with the Servo Controllers, it is allowed.

Per &lt;RE06&gt;d, "Other electronics are not allowed." However, we are using ours as a form of manufactured sensor, which would be allowed under &lt;RE06&gt;b.i, where our Arduino is exclusively used for sensor purposes and is only connected to another sensor and the Core Device Interface Module. <br>
<br>
If the Arduino would not be considered a manufactured sensor, why? It is not exclusively allowed or disallowed in the rules, and we used ours to great advantage last year through the HiTechnic SuperPro board. There seems to be no reason that the rules should have changed in this matter, since so many teams used this last year.<br>
<br>
A comment earlier referenced that communication with an Arduino would require additional drivers, which may be an argument against it. However I already have a working prototype for communication with said Arduino through the I2C bus of the Core Device Interface Module, so it is definitely compatible for this year's game with a little work by the team, making the argument invalid.<br>
<br>

Is there any way to use 3.3v sensors with the Core Device Interface Module? Currently, my team only has access to 3.3v versions of the sensors that we require, however under &lt;RE03&gt;h, "External power adapters or voltage converters are not allowed." It would be cost prohibitive to buy new sensors when we already have the 3.3v sensors and voltage converters that are required for communication over I2C to the Core Device Interface Module.<br>

A1: Arduino systems are not allowed per FTC Q&amp;A Electronics Forum post #2 and post #18 (answers A3 &amp; A4)<br>

In the future we'll use worm gears, but for now we have to deal with the back-drive issue.  One method that one of the team found during his research was "motor braking" where the terminals of a motor, when shorted together, would cause a motor to stop back-driving (mostly).  This led to two designs and questions:<br>
<br>
1 - Once the robot was hanging, the driver would press the controller button that would cause a servo to short the two motor wires together.  The servo has a cleverly designed servo horn that will make/break electrical connections.  After refinement of the design and with an eye toward potentially saving our fuses, the servo would first break the connection to the motor controller then short the motor wires together. Our read of the rules, particularly &lt;RE02&gt; and &lt;RE05&gt; still left us wondering if this is legal?<br>
<br>
2 - If the answer to #1 is "yes it is legal" - would using a DPDT switch (activated by the servo) also be legal?  I would feel much better using a switch than the previous approach.<br>
<br>
A: No. For safety reasons, motors may only be controlled by motor controllers.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Our follow-up question:<br>
<br>
Would a volt meter be allowed if it can only be activated by holding down a button and the button would never be activated in a competition? Such a configuration in our thinking would serve no purpose other than being extra weight during a competition, but would allow us to check the battery between competitions without removing it. Another justification would be electronics that are not connected to electricity aren't really electronics (maybe a broad ruling such as this would be useful for other teams).<br>

<br>
Ruling #33 and its followup #41 are somewhat unclear, and seem rather backwards when interpreted in the strict sense. They appear to extend the limitations of modifications on servos specified in &lt;RE02&gt; to the sellers, not just the manufacturers.  Therefore, is the onus on the teams to ensure that their servo vendor has not made modifications (i.e. contact the seller if the listing is unclear), or is it simply that a servo which is advertised as modified post-manufacturing is illegal?  In addition, what exactly is the definition of a seller versus a manufacturer?  Our interpretation was that a manufacturer is any entity that took components that do not qualify as a servo, and then modified or machined those components into something that does qualify as a servo.  Under &lt;RE02&gt;, the team cannot be the entity that is the manufacturer.  However, a custom-servo manufacturer could be the entity.  This seems to be a bit backwards, as a team could order a custom servo to circumvent any &lt;RE02&gt; rule, while being forbidden from customizing servos themselves.<br>

FTC is currently aware of USB connection issues in relation to the batteries. ( http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4993-Update-on-USB-Disconnect-Issues-%28unable-to-detect-USB-modules-during-scan%29 ) When the batteries are low they give off ~9.5 volts rather than 12. This low voltage is then further stepped down in the PDM to power the USBs, but if the input power is too low, the USBs fail. We feel that a voltage regulator between the battery and the PDM would alleviate the issue, allow teams to fully utilize their battery power, and correct any other issues that may be caused by voltage. Allowed 12 volt Batteries that have full charge have a voltage of ~14 volts, which widens the range of voltage, and could also potentially lead to issues, though it is unlikely. A fixed 12 volt regulator can be bought for as cheap as $1.50, making this easily accessible to almost all teams. <br>

<br>
To clarify our previous question, we are using a Legacy Matrix system with a single 9.6V battery, two Matrix motor/servo controllers, and three Matrix 9.6V motors. We have been unable to source additional Matrix motors from Modern Robotics Inc., of any sort, and so we would like to use two or three of the AndyMark NeveRest (20,40,60) series of motors, with our Matrix module to drive additional mechanisms. We do not want to waste our money buying motors we cannot use, so we have not finished some of our mechanisms. The motors are rated at 12V, but we have heard from another team that they work fine on 9.6V - they simply run slower than they would at 12V, with no risk of damaging them. Is using NeveRest motors with the 9.6V Legacy a legal configuration? <br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
A: After getting input from the manufacturers, 12v motors (of any of the allowed types) can be used with any of the Motor Controllers (Matrix, Legacy HiTechnic, Modern Robotics).  Please note that the motor connectors may need to be changed. Care should be taken to fully understand the connections before modifying the motor connectors to minimize the chance of damage to the motors or controllers.<br>
<br>
Teams should also be aware that the encoders that are built into several of the motors produce different counts per revolution and will likely make using the built-in PID control functionality difficult.</div></div><hr>

Are either of these (https://www.adafruit.com/products/593, or https://www.adafruit.com/products/292) similar devices which expand an i2c port allowed to be connected to the CDIM in order to get more digital type pins?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
FTC 5206, The Knights of Ni<br>
<br>
A: No.  The I2C multiplexor option was allowed to take care of the case where sensors have non-changeable i2c addresses.  The allowance permits using multiple sensors of the same type.<br>
<br>
The chips/boards referenced above are general purpose I/O expanders and fall under the category of "other electronics" and are prohibited by &lt;RE06&gt;.d</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">03-08-2016, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post #118 of the Mechanical thread (http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4623-Robot-Inspection-and-Build-Rules-Mechanical-Answer-Thread&amp;p=26298&amp;viewfull=1#post26298) states that the mentioned red dot scopes are illegal because they are not powered by the main robot battery. However, it does not say anything about the legality of them. Would a red dot scope (NOT a laser) that is powered by the main robot battery be legal? Thanks!<br>
<br>
A: "Red Dot" scopes are not legal. Focused light sources are disallowed by &lt;R06&gt;.a</div></div><hr>

<br>
Would this battery pack be considered an internal battery?  It's an LED strip with an internal battery holder which holds three AA batteries.<br>

A: Yes.  The above product is an example of a vendor supplied battery for LED's as allowed by &lt;RE03&gt;.g</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">03-08-2016, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;RE05&gt;.h states:<br>
"Power and motor control wires must use consistent color coding with different colors used for the Positive (red, white, brown, or black with a stripe) and Negative/Common (black or blue) wires."<br>
<br>
It specifically states for "power and motor control".  If we use extension wires for sensors (analog and i2c), does the "consistent color coding" portion of the above statement also apply?  For example, if a sensor is soldered with 4 colored wires, and a 4 wire extension that has 4 different colors extends the connection to the DIM controller, is that legal?<br>
<br>
Thanks....<br>
<br>
A: Yes. In your example, the wires you are extending include power/ground and have a color convention that denotes power/ground vs. signal.  Care should be taken to match the convention.  The colors used in your extensions do not need to be identical to the wiring that is being extended, but should be clearly identifiable and the same color convention you use should be applied consistently to all extensions.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">04-06-2016, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't see limits for servo Amperage in the Game manual, but do note that the MR modules are only rated for 1.5A per servo and that according to ServoCity, the stall current for quarterscale servos is 1.8A and the popular 645MG servos is 1.6A.    We're not sure this poses a real safety problem, but would like to confirm that the use of quarterscale servos and the 645MG servos are legal even though the specs on the servo controller say we shouldn't be using them.<br>
<br>
A: This question has already been addressed. Please see post #9 (http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4624-Robot-Inspection-and-Build-Rules-Electrical-Answer-Thread&amp;p=17427&amp;viewfull=1#post17427) under the Robot Inspection and build Rules - Electrical - Answer thread.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Earthquake</div><div class="date">04-13-2016, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a quick question to clarify what the limits are on the servos we are allowed to use.<br>
<br>
&lt;RE04&gt; states that the servos are limited to 12 in number and that any compatible servos are allowed barring the fact that they don't overload the servo controller.  But then on this document posted:  http://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/2015-2016-legal-illegal-parts-list.pdf it states clearly that all servos must be rated at 800mA or less.<br>
<br>
Can you please clarify?  Thank you<br>
<br>
A: As long as the servo is compatible with the servo controller and the total stall current for all servos controlled by a single controller does not exceed 5 amps the servo is allowed.</div></div><hr>
