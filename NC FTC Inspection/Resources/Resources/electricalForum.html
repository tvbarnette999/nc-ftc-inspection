Is it acceptable to purchase this battery to save money?<br />
<br />
https://www.servocity.com/12v-3000mah-nimh-battery-with-tamiya-connector-20amp-ato-blade-fuse<br />
<br />
Answer: No. Only the batteries listed in &lt;RE03&gt; are legal for use in FTC Robots<br />
<br />
Legal, approved batteries can be purchased through the following vendors:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-10-2016, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the question was already asked, but here is a point to consider regarding the battery at :<br />
https://www.servocity.com/12v-3000mah-nimh-battery-with-tamiya-connector-20amp-ato-blade-fuse<br />
<br />
Not only is there NO difference between this and the &quot;official&quot; tetrix battery, but the biggest issue is that there is NO way to tell them apart.  Neither one, including the Tetrix battery, actually has a mfg. part number on it.  I think the rules group may want to rethink this because frankly, MANY teams are already buying the Servocity battery because is cheaper, and is actually identical to the Tetrix battery.  We have one ourselves, and there is frankly no way to determine which one it is.<br />
<br />
Just food for thought, and there is no reason to post an answer unless you want to.  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Answer: The only legal batteries are those listed in Part 1 of the Game Manual. The ServoCity battery, while similar to the TETRIX battery, is NOT in the approved list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-17-2016, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were wondering if we would be allowed to use an Arduino board with its own power to create decorative lighting patterns on our robot. The lights would serve no operational purpose, and would be purely for decoration.<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;RE12&gt; states &quot;Light sources (including LEDs) are allowed; these may not be focused or directed in any way (for example: lasers and mirrors are not allowed). Approved light sources may include an internal (as supplied by the manufacturer) battery pack or battery holder.&quot; And &lt;RE17&gt; states &quot;Electronic devices that are not specifically addressed in the preceding rules are not allowed. A partial list of electronics that are not allowed includes: Arduino boards, Raspberry Pi, relays, and custom circuits.&quot; However, we were wondering if &lt;RE17&gt; only applied to functional robot electronics, and not decorative lighting. Also, is it the intent of the GDC with &lt;RE12&gt; to allow only pre-manufactured light strings that provide their own power, and not for teams to be able to roll their own systems, except for using the main 12V battery?<br />
<br />
Answer: No. All aspects of the robot (including purely decorative aspects) must abide by the robot construction rules. Arduino boards (and similar systems) fall into the &quot;Other Electronics&quot; class that is disallowed by &lt;RE17&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-20-2016, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are Solenoid Actuators legal parts?<br />
https://www.amazon.com/a14050600ux0309-2-Wires-Solenoid-Electromagnet-Actuator/dp/B016MMP374/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476847015&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=12volt+solenoid+actuator+25mm<br />
<br />
A: Solenoids fall under &quot;other electronics&quot; &lt;RE17&gt; and are not allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-24-2016, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our robot has a gear rack that is pulled back under spring tension by the motor.  However, if the motor runs past its limit, then it will break the gear rack and potentially release the springs, creating an unsafe robot, as we can't ensure that other pieces will not fly off.  In order to prevent this, we have installed a limit switch inline with the motor power line, automatically tripping the power if the gear rack extends too far.  This works extremely well from our tests.<br />
<br />
However, the current rules against &quot;other electronics&quot; render this illegal for a competition robot, as the limit switch is not a &quot;sensor&quot; because it does not connect to the DIM.  We do not want to run the limit switch into the DIM and use the phone to control the motor based on this feedback because of the program's failure modes.  We know that the phone's software is subject to various freezing and discon&#65532;nect issues.  We also know that during these failures modes, all motors will continue to run regardless.  Since this could both break our robot and cause somewhat of a safety hazard, we are asking that an exception be made for such cases.  We are still adhering to the requirements for minimum wire gauge, and the limit switch is rated for 10A at 120VAC, which is well over the 5A, 12V max draw of the motors.  In addition, from our tests, the motor rarely draws more than a few amps, meaning that 5A is more of a peak condition.  <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
9791<br />
<br />
Answer:  The limit switch inline with a motor indeed falls under the &quot;Other Electronics&quot; category and is not allowed per &lt;RE17&gt;.</div></div><hr />

LED's would be controlled by a motor controller port.<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team would like to know if it is legal to &quot;Chassis Ground&quot; the robot. They want to wire the negative leads of the modern robotics controllers and of the motors to the metal of the robot. The positive leads would connect to the positive poles of their sources as usual.<br />
There doesn't seem to be a rule allowing or forbidding this. Is it a legal way to wire the robot?<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Answer: No, using the robot frame as an electrical connector is NOT allowed. In addition being unsafe (grossly increases risks of short circuits) and violation the wiring rules for appropriate wire gauge usage, the scheme as described would not work.  <br />
<br />
Hint - It is important to remember that the motor connections are NOT fixed polarity. The M+/M- connections on the motor controllers switch polarity based on the motor directions.  Under your scheme, the first time you reversed your motors, you would likely trip the thermal breaker in the motor controller, if not the one of the fuses in either the Power Distribution module or the battery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can we use the adafruit PWM driver (https://www.adafruit.com/products/815) to control LEDs as long as all power comes from the Device Interface Module.<br />
<br />
Answer: No. The module you referenced falls into the &quot;Additional Electronics&quot; category and is not allowed per &lt;RE17&gt;.<br />
<br />
TIP - The module you referenced is very similar in function to a Motor Controller. Similar control of LEDs can be accomplished with a Motor Controller.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-09-2016, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Is it permissible to attach two legal motors to a single Motor Controller port by soldering the two wires to make a &quot;y&quot; splitter?  Please see the attached picture.  Thank you.<br />
<br />
Answer:  There is nothing in the rules that would prohibit the connection of two motors to a single motor controller port via a splitter cable.  <br />
<br />
Note: Care should be taken to pay attention to the current driving limits of the Core Motor Controller.  The CMC has internal thermal breaker that will open when excess load is drawn from the controller resulting in the controller being inoperable until the breaker resets. Two motors under stall conditions would likely exceed the CMC current limit!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-21-2016, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the beginning of the 2015 (Res-Q) season the game manual (and a Q&amp;A Forum post) stated that standalone main power switches &quot;must be either TETRIX #W39129 or MATRIX #50-00300.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since then the rule wording has been changed so that &lt;RE01&gt;.a now states: &quot;FIRST strongly recommends that Teams purchase a separate Main Power Switch, either TETRIX (part #W39129) or MATRIX (part# 50-0030).&quot;<br />
<br />
Q:  If using a separate Main Power Switch, are teams still constrained to the TETRIX and MATRIX switches listed or can other (appropriately sized/rated) switches be used as Main Power Switches?<br />
<br />
(This question came up during robot inspections at an event yesterday.)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Answer:  &lt;RE01&gt; allows teams to choose either of 2 configurations for main power control:<br />
<br />
 A separate switch (either of two specific TETRIX and MATRIX part numbers)<br />
 The switch on the Core Power Distribution Module<br />
 <br />
<br />
If a separate switch is used, it must be one of the specifically listed switches.<br />
<br />
Tip: Teams are only required to abide by the rules in THIS YEAR's game manuals; last year's game manual has no bearing on this year's game. In general, rules change year-to-year.  Constraints from prior years may be relaxed or tightened in the current year.  Teams should ALWAYS take the time to read and understand the ENTIRE game manual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is an IR receiver to change the colors and we could maybe have that disconnect if needed, but we don't have them yet so don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
Answer: the LED's by themselves are legal if they can be powered and controlled via legal methods.  The IR receiver block is not legal (per &lt;RE17&gt;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks!<br />
<br />
Answer: The device appears to be an I2C controlled LED module and does not meet the LED limits as listed in &lt;RE12&gt; and as such would fall under &lt;RE17&gt; and not be allowed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">12-13-2016, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Game manual part 1 rule RE03 states battery Matrix part # 14-0014 is a legal battery. We have nine FTC teams and purchased new batteries from Modern Robotics. Below is the URL to the product. The part number is 14-0014 but the batteries we received have a label that says &quot;Modern Robotics&quot; not &quot;Matrix&quot;. Exact same battery with a different label. In two separate competitions we were told the batteries are not legal because they are labeled &quot;Modern Robotics&quot;. The judges said that Modern Robotics parts are not allowed. We showed the judges the website and manual. We were allowed to compete in that specific regional but were told we needed to verify with FIRST before moving on to future competitions. Please clarify for us. We assumed the part number was correct since it it listed in the manual. <br />
<br />
http://www.modernroboticsinc.com/12v-3000mah-nimh-battery<br />

<br />
https://www.amazon.com/So-myshtech-Connector-15-pin-Terminal-Breakout/dp/B014H47NLI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481666882&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=so-myshtech<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Circuit Breakers - 6566<br />
<br />
Answer: The connector is legal as long as the use does not violate any other rules.  In particular, care should be taken to make sure that all connections made via this type of connector fit within the current limits for the connector. (i.e. the per pin current limits could prohibit running motor connections through the connector). Appropriate wire gauges should also be used for all connections and the connections should be well insulated for safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">12-14-2016, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
As recommended by:<br />
<br />
&lt;RE01&gt; Main Power Switch - The Robot Main Power Switch must control all power provided by the Robot main battery pack and it must be used in one (1) of the following configurations:<br />
a. FIRST strongly recommends that Teams purchase a separate Main Power Switch, either TETRIX (part #W39129) or MATRIX (part# 50-0030). This is the safest method for Teams and Field personnel to shut down a Robot.<br />
<br />
We purchased a MATRIX (part# 50-0030) switch. However, the MATRIX switch comes with 18 gauge wire (FTC rules say power wire should be at least 16 gauge) and is only rated for 6 amps (whereas the battery and core controller are both fused to 20 amps).<br />
<br />
So, it appears that the MATRIX (part# 50-0030) that we are required to buy does not meet the FTC rules (for power wire gauge) and is substantially under-rated (6 amps vs. 20 amps) for the entire system.<br />
<br />
Given this, can we use a 3rd party switch that is rated for 20amps?<br />
<br />
If not, what are we suppose to do (we cannot use the core controller switch, as cannot make it accessible):<br />
- Install the MATRIX (part # 50-0030) switch - It seems it will probably melt (has anyone used this switch? Does it melt?)<br />
- What are we suppose to do with the illegal wire that came on switch? (has anyone competed with this switch/wiring?)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
FTC BlueSmoke Team<br />
<br />
Answer: The switch you have purchased is selected by Modern Robotics for use with the Matrix system and is safe to use.  The current ratings you are reading from the switch are AC ratings (6A@125V) not DC ratings.<br />
<br />
The only two legal external power switches are the two explicitly listed in &lt;RE01&gt;<br />
<br />
The wire gauge rules  in &lt;RE14&gt; are for use by teams in modifying, extending, custom making, etc., wiring within the robot (i.e. anything your team makes or modifies should follow the guidance in &lt;RE14&gt;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-04-2017, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it legal to attach an additional 12-volt battery to the robot to provide power to the undirected LED lights on the robot?<br />
<br />
Answer: No, unless the battery is an internal battery (as supplied by the LED manufacturer) as listed in &lt;RE12&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-11-2017, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;RE03&gt; states &quot;Robot main power is provided by exactly one (1) battery pack that connects<br />
directly to a single Core Power Distribution Module or through a switch that connects to a single Core Power<br />
Distribution Module. Voltage and/or current sensors are allowed to connect between the battery pack and the<br />
Core Power Distribution Module.&quot;<br />
Our robot still has the battery connected to the PDM but we have an additional wire with a ring at the end (to attach to the chassis) branching off the negative PDM wire. <br />
<br />
Question: Is it legal to ground the negative PDM wire to the chassis of the robot?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-11-2017, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some question about LED lighting.<br />
<br />
 1. It is our understanding that you can not power low voltage (~2v) LED's from the 5v outputs on the CDIM (these outputs are current limited and work great).  Could this be considered next year?<br />
<br />
 2. If we use the core power distribution module and a motor controller to power them, we would need a current limiting resistor in the circuit. Is this allowed?<br />
<br />
 3. Would the following lights be allowed?    <br />
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IR23JGA/ref=twister_B00IXD7GKI?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1<br />
<br />
 4.Can you use common cathode RGB LED's<br />
https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Common-Cathode-Emitting-Diodes/dp/B005VMDROS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483836615&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rgb+led<br />
and wire the common to the core power distribution module and pick up the positives from separate outputs on a motor controller?<br />
<br />
Answer 1: We cannot comment on what will or won't be considered for next year's rules.  In general we are always trying to find ways to allow teams to express their creativity in a safe and manageable manner.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes. A current limiting resistor would be allowed.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: We are not able to comment on the legality of each individual possible LED.  Be aware that very bright LEDs are likely to raise concerns at the playing field.<br />
<br />
Answer 4: It is not safe to cross wire between a motor controller and the CPDM. If an LED is being controlled by a motor controller, all connections to the LED should come from the motor controller.  Furthermore, it is not safe to cross wire multiple motor controller outputs to a single device of any sort.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I'm from team 3491 FIXIT,<br />
We are wondering if it would be legal to plug a non-powered USB into the Core Power Module. The power module only has room for 7 USB devices and it is quite likely we will need eight modules this year. <br />
<br />
Last year we had 1 Core Device interface<br />
3 Motor Controllers<br />
3 Servo Controllers - We understand that the there are 6 servo ports for 12 servos, but if you use any servo that is more powerful that the HS-422 there is too much power used and the servo controller shuts off. We had to split into three controllers to avoid this issue.<br />
<br />
This year we are considering using a mecanum drive so we will need a fourth motor controller. The only way to achieve this would be to add a splitter to the power module.<br />
<br />
Thanks Team 3491<br />
<br />
Answer: &lt;RE14&gt;.d explicitly allows stand-alone USB hubs to be used on robots (both powered and unpowered). Powered USB hubs need to be compatible with the 12v power that is available on the robot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 1.5.1: After placing their Robot on the Playing Field, the Drive Team selects their Autonomous Period Operational<br />
Mode (Op Mode) on their Driver Station Android device and initializes their Robot by triggering the Team’s<br />
initialization event software. <br />
<br />
Is this order strictly enforced?  May a team initialize the robot prior during the process of placing it?  For example, we are considering having a touch sensor configured to indicate to the software what color the robot is.  So we would place the robot, initialize the software, and then touch the sensor if the robot was blue.  Is this allowed?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Answer: The method you have described is compatible with the description in Section 1.5.1.  You should take care to make sure that your setup and initialization is done in a timely manner.  Field personnel (Referees and/or FTAs) will likely NOT allow you back onto the field to take care of pressing your sensor if you forget before leaving the field.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-09-2016, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings, rules people:<br />
<br />
&lt;RE14&gt; (d) says &quot;Stand-alone USB hubs are allowed.&quot;<br />
&lt;RE17&gt; Says &quot;Electronic devices that are not specifically addressed in preceding rules are not allowed : partial list includes... . and custom circuits.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, how about a custom stand-alone USB hub? <br />
<br />
Our teams are frustrated with the mechanical design of the motor controllers (as I'm sure many of us are).   Having large wires exit from each controller along 3 of the controller's planes is really annoying in an 18&quot; robot.  USB cables and connectors are huge, connectors fail easily.<br />
<br />
To make wiring simpler, it occurred to us that we could mount the motor controllers on top of one another in a tight stack, like the plug-in cards of the old FRC cRIO.    The stack arrangement was popular in the old NXT/Hitechnic system.<br />
<br />
- Would it be within the rules to fabricate a custom stand-alone USB hub that would form a &quot;backplane&quot; that the motor controllers fit into?   This creates a mechanically stable connection to the motor controller and requires no modifications to any Modern Robotics parts.  The custom hub would be plugged into the PDC.<br />
<br />
- If a custom-built hub is not permitted, could a small COTS hub be modified (removed from its enclosure, connectors removed and short wires soldered on) for this purpose?<br />
<br />
Modifying a COTS hub may violate &lt;RE15&gt; though, especially if connectors are removed.  Moving a COTS hub from its supplied enclosure to a new one appears to be within the scope of &lt;RE15&gt; <br />
<br />
A custom hub will not provide any robot performance advantage over a COTS one, the purpose of constructing it is purely for mechanical compactness and electrical stability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer:  A fully custom hub would not be allowed as it would fall under the definitions of &quot;Additional Electronics&quot; and &lt;RE17&gt;.  Applying &lt;RE15&gt; as it is written would allow for modification of a hub that did not have connectors mounted to the circuit boards, but had an &quot;octopus&quot; type of wired fan-out. (i.e. Replacing or adding connectors on wires ...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-21-2016, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: Do Robot Rules RE07 and RE08 limit the quantity of Legacy Tetrix motor/servo controllers?<br />
<br />
&lt;RE07&gt; Control Module Quantities - Robot control module quantities are constrained as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.       Exactly one (1) Core Power Distribution Module is required.<br />
2.       No more than two (2) Core Device Interface Modules are allowed.<br />
3.       No more than two (2) Core Legacy Modules are allowed.<br />
4.       Any quantity of Core Motor and Core Servo Controllers are allowed.<br />
5.       No more than two (2) Legacy MATRIX DC Motor/Servo Controllers (unified module) are allowed. <br />
<br />
&lt;RE08&gt; Motor and Servo Controllers - Motor and Servo Controllers are allowed in only one of the following two configurations (cannot mix configurations).<br />
<br />
<br />
1.       Core Motor Controllers, Core Servo Controllers, Legacy TETRIX DC Motor Controllers, and Legacy TETRIX Servo Controllers in any combination.<br />
2.       Legacy MATRIX DC Motor/Servo Controllers (unified module). <br />
<br />
Question 2: If this was the intent of rule RE07.5 , why hasn't the wording been changed in Game Manual Part 1 or on the Robot Inspection Checklist?<br />
<br />
Question 3: How are teams supposed to know that this is the intent?<br />
<br />
Please clarify.<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
Answer 1: &lt;RE07&gt; does not expressly limit the number of Legacy TETRIX Motor or Legacy TETRIX Servo Controllers. &lt;RE08&gt; does not limit quantities, it constrains the types of controller configurations allowed.<br />
<br />
The Robot Inspection Checklist does not state a limit for Motor controllers or Servo controllers (either Modern Robotics Core or TETRIX)<br />
<br />
Answer 2: &lt;RE07&gt;.e is a limit on the Legacy MATRIX Motor/Servo Controller (unified module) and makes no mention of Legacy TETRIX controllers<br />
<br />
Answer 3: Teams should read/understand the game manuals</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Because the modification involves changing or modifying the gears and does not involve the electronics or wiring this modification is allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">11-16-2016, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there!  We just went through an inspection before our league meet and the inspector told us that we needed to have the servo movement stickers next to EACH servo that was on our robot, not just a single one to alert folks that the servos might move.  In the past we only needed one and it's not exactly convenient for us to have a place to put those near every servo.  Do we really need multiple stickers, or will one do for the entire robot?<br />
<br />
A: Rule &lt;RG03b&gt; requires just one warning label located near the Main Power switch.</div></div><hr />

There is no notion that they are, or are not.  It is just the rotational ones that are allowed.  Assuming the connection to the servo controller is the same, can a linear servo be used?<br />
<br />
Answer: &lt;RE10&gt; does not constrain the nature of the output of a servo.  For a servo to be legal, it must:<br />
<br />
 be marketed/sold as a servo<br />
 be electrically compatible with allowed Servo Controllers (6v and within the current limit for the controller)<br />
 be controlled/powered by an allowed Servo Controller<br />
<br />
<br />
Team using &quot;unusual&quot; servos should be prepared to support the legality of their servos by bringing documentation for the servo (specifications, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raj</div><div class="date">11-28-2016, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team and I were wondering whether it is legal per rule RG01J to remove air from a funnel using a vacuum pump. We are not compressing or storing air and there are no pistons or valves involved in the design. The vacuum pump is from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Karlsson-Robotics-D2028-Volt-Vacuum/dp/B00DYA21PU. We are not using the motor that comes with the pump. We are converting it to an AndyMark NeverRest motor.  Inside the pump is a piece that spins. This pieces turns at an offset and makes the rubber part on the outside pump out the air from the funnel. There is only one degree of freedom in this design. Thanks so much!<br />
<br />
A: We found out that it is a diaphragm pump.  Our ruling is that as long as the outport port of the pump is not blocked or sent through a hose, the pump should not build up any pressure.  If those constraints are followed, then this would be considered a legal part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">12-06-2016, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please clarify the legality of this Servo:  https://www.servocity.com/hdls-12-2-12v<br />
<br />
Assuming  it is controllable from the   MR Servo Controller Module and meets the  specified power requirements, is it legal because of Rule  RE 10    as it labeled as a servo, or is it illegal because it violates the COTS  1 DOF rule  RM 02?<br />
<br />
Answer: This servo is not allowed. This servo is not compatible with the allowed servo controllers.  It requires a 12v power connection in addition to the standard servo control signals.</div></div><hr />

We would like to control 2 additional servos and are wondering if we need to use another controller to do so. I understand the 5 amp stall requirements, so I suspect the answer is no. Our servos and motors will be used one at a time, so having multiple stalled devices is unlikely. Thanks for you reply.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the pixy still a permitted sensor like last year?<br />
Assuming the Following:<br />
a) it is the sole device on a Device Interface Module (DIM);<br />
b) it draws less than the 150ma DIM maximum current;<br />
c) it is in this context only an I2C device<br />
Would the Pixy still be a permitted sensor?<br />
See also http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer: As long as an intelligent sensor (one that includes an embedded processor) does not provide a programming capacity to the user, it is legal. The Pixy referenced does not provide a programming API for the end user and is an example of a legal intelligent sensor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello from team 3491 FIXIT,<br />
We are wondering if it would be legal to use sensors that plug directly into the phone through a USB port on the power module. We have tested this and it is fully functional with the FTC_app. There is no asynchronous serial communication on the sensor module so using USB would allows teams to use a multitude of useful sensors. We are especially interested in using a USB webcam and or an HID Mouse.<br />
<br />
Thanks team 3941<br />
<br />
Answer: No.  &lt;RE11&gt; only allows sensors that connect to and are powered by the Core Device Interface Module. &lt;RE17&gt; disallows all electronics not explicitly allowed via other rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be legal to have a custom printed / routed circuit board that consists entirely of copper traces, connector pins, and a legal I2C multiplexer? Reading the manual, this seems to be a bit of a grey area between RE14-J and RE17.<br />
<br />
RE11-E allows simple I2C multiplexers, so that is not in question<br />
<br />
RE14-J allows that &quot;sensor wires and their connectors may be extended, modified, custom made&quot;<br />
<br />
RE17 disallows &quot;custom circuits&quot;<br />
<br />
The circuit board would simply provide a more convenient arrangement of plugs to interface with the multiplexer.<br />
<br />
Answer: a simple circuit board that serves only to interconnect other legal electronics is allowed per &lt;RE14&gt;.j.<br />
<br />
Care should be taken to ensure that the circuit board is adequately insulated. In this particular case, the only power for the I2C multiplexer MUST come from the I2C connections available on the Core Device Interface Module. <br />
<br />
It would be prudent to bring a circuit schematic for the interface to all competitions and be prepared to explain the interface to the inspectors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-07-2016, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it permissible to connect a passive resistor to a sensor (e.g. a switch) to allow it to be connected to the Device Interface Module? We'd like to use generic limit switches wired as in http://playground.arduino.cc/CommonTopics/PullUpDownResistor.<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes.  &lt;RE11&gt;.b explicitly allows the use of passive electronics at the interface to sensors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-17-2016, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is positioning a white LED next to a light sensor (such as https://www.adafruit.com/products/2748) to improve line following sensitivity allowed per RE12?<br />
<br />
Answer: &lt;RE12&gt; does not limit the usage of LEDs. It provides guidance and limitations on how LEDs within a legal robot may be powered.  As long as your proposed usage powers the LED in accordance with &lt;RE12&gt; it would be allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a purchased sensor that is a collection of discreet sensors combined with an I2C digital I/O interface on a single PCB. <br />
<br />
There is already a feature on the PCB that allows disabling the sensor array via I2C, but we would like to reverse this feature so it powers up disabled and we turn on via I2C. Conveniently this can be done by simply adding a SMT resistor to pullup an unbiased mosfet ... also conveniently there is a 5V input filter cap exactly 0603 away from the gate.<br />
<br />
We wanted to verify that adding a resistor to improve sensor usability is allowed as long as we can justify by schematic that it doesn't violate any safety function of the design.<br />
<br />
Answer: No. The modification describe is not allowed based on &lt;RE15&gt;.  The modification is a change to the internal circuitry of the PCB. &lt;RE11&gt;.b allows for passive electronics to be added to sensors, but only at the interfaces to the sensors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the clarification about adding a resistor to a purchased PCB sensor array. Glad we asked.<br />
<br />
Just to be 100% clear we are allowed to design a pcb that combines an array of individual sensors, passive components and connectors and use i2c voltage sensor to read the sensors. We understand it can only be powered from device interface module, we need a schematic to explain its composition to inspectors and it cannot have any component that is programmable ... also it should be well insulated  :)<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes.  Also, make sure to pay attention to current capacity for any signals routed through the circuit board. The circuit board traces should be designed to ensure sufficient current capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">11-22-2016, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it legal for a team to use a sensor if it is a manufactured sensor mounted on a custom printed circuit board containing only passive components as recommended by the sensor manufacturer?<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes.  Be prepared to show a schematic of the circuit to the inspectors and discuss/describe the design as part of the robot inspection process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">12-06-2016, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is Adafruit's time-of-flight distance sensor: https://www.adafruit.com/products/3317<br />
legal?<br />
The rules say that &quot;compatible sensors from any manufacturer are allowed&quot;; on the other hand, it contains &quot;a very tiny invisible laser source&quot;.<br />
<br />
Answer: No. Lasers of any form are not allowed per &lt;RE12&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-05-2017, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!<br />
We are hoping to design and use an array of discreet, passive components as a rudimentary sensor. We would be using an array of resistors and switches to pass a voltage value into the CDIM. Would this be allowed under the rules? Thank you!<br />
<br />
Answer: It appears that you are describing building a voltage divider network controlled by a set of switches.  As described, the design is a custom circuit and does not meet the use of passive components as allowed in &lt;RE11&gt;.b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-11-2017, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it legal to use the LED included on the Adafruit TCS34725 (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334#description-anchor) color sensor? If not, will be sufficient to just ground the LED pin with a soldered wire rather than take up a slot on the CDIM? (The schematic: https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/015/703/original/light_colorsenseschem.png?1396450096) Thank you!<br />
<br />
Answer: If the LED is being used as intended (i.e. as a light sources for reflected light sensing) it may be used. Grounding of the LED control pin is also acceptable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-11-2017, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rules clearly specify which motors to use, but they don't mention anything about encoders.<br />
<br />
My team is using the encoder ports of the motor controller to do telemetry on passive wheels and arm joints. We were unable to find I2C encoders and the Tetrix optical encoder isn't a good choice in their application.<br />
Is it possible to use any 3rd part quadrature or 2-sensor encoders such as:<br />
<br />
http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/670/amt10-v-534894.pdf<br />
http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/678/V02-4926EN_DS_AEDM-55xx_2016-01-18-908552.pdf<br />
or<br />
http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/670/amt20-534922.pdf<br />
<br />
We would need to make a connector to only get the 5V, GND and channels A + B to the motor controller, but it should be compatible.<br />
<br />
Team #11115 - Gluten Free<br />
<br />
Answer: The sensors themselves are allowed.  Connecting them to the motor controllers is not allowed. Current rules only allow 3rd party sensors to be connected to the CDIM (&lt;RE11&gt;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-18-2017, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team would like to use a switch wired to a digital input port of the DIM. We want to use it to switch between red and blue versions of autonomous code. I told them we could use a touch sensor since it is a switch, but they would like to use the switch. It would be wired with a 10-50K resistor inline with the 5 volt wire to reduce current flow. Is this legal?  Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Team # 11260<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes, as long as the switch is wired as a sensor to a CDIM as allowed in &lt;RE11&gt;.a</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wil Wheaton</div><div class="date">01-18-2017, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;The team would like to use either a touch sensor (switch/digital sensor) or a potentiometer (analog sensor) to set parameters for the robot.

Rather than create multiple programs that delay 5-seconds, 10-seconds, ... for both red and blue.  We would like to have a potentiometer that we can adjust (0 to 15 seconds) before each match to set the time delay. Is this legal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes, as long as the potentiometer is wired to a CDIM as allowed in &lt;RE11&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When the Moto G 3rd gen phone was added to the approved android device list on Aug 1, our group purchased eight of these phones (with FIRST STEM equity grant money) to use with 4 grant funded FTC teams. These phones simply do not function reliably with non-powered USB hubs and 2 Logitech game pads.  The procedure posted by Tom Eng on the FTC forum in early September only occasionally works. Most of the time, we find ourselves just plugging, unplugging, rebooting, etc until it just happens to work - sometimes taking 5-10 minutes. As a Coach and Qualifier Tournament Director, I know that simply isn't going to work at competition.  The only thing I can find that works is to use a hub that can have a USB battery attached to power the external devices. I'm currently using this one:<br />
<br />
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5XY8EE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br />
<br />
The problem is, that basically becomes a powered hub that seems to be unallowed by the rules. Can you please advise how we are supposed to use these approved Moto G 3rd gen phones and still be in compliance with the rules? Replacing them is not a financially viable option. <br />
<br />
Our 5th team has ZTE phones from last year - those seem completely fine with all of the same hubs and game pads, as does my unapproved Galaxy Note4. The problem is clearly the phones.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Jim Jackson<br />
Coach: teams 10780, 11296,11296,11298,11300<br />
<br />
This configuration would be legal per rule &lt;RE06&gt;d. If a user connects a USB portable battery to their non-powered USB hub, we found that the Moto G 3rd gen phones work reliably with the existing non-powered USB hub and the Logitech F310 gamepads.<br />
<br />
Teams would need to purchase a USB portable battery and a Type A to Type A (male to male) adapter or cable.</div></div><hr />
