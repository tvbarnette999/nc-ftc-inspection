<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-22-2016, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 5.3.1 of the Game Manual Part 1 asks teams to reflect on their Robot's design and the question: “If everybody did this, would the game play be impossible? If the answer to the question is yes, the design component is probably not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
VELOCITY VORTEX is played with Particles that are Scored in goals and recycled back to the Playing Field for continuous game play. The Game Design Committee's intent is for open recycling, where Scored Particles return to random locations on the Playing Field Floor so that both Robots on an Alliance have an equal opportunity to access, Control, or Possess their Alliance's Scored Particles. A closed recycling game strategy that denies a reasonable opportunity for an Alliance Partner Robot to access, Control, or Possess a Scored Particle is not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge and is not allowed. Game play with closed recycling of Particles would be impossible and unfair to Alliance Partners. Therefore, Robot designs and/or game strategies that deny their Alliance Partner equal access to Scored Particles, is considered to be a violation of rule &lt;GS2&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-24-2016, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal to purposefully control the rotation of the Center Vortex?<br />
Answer: Yes, Robots may purposefully Control the rotation of the Center Vortex, provided that no other rules are violated. For example, rules &lt;S1&gt;, &lt;G14&gt;, &lt;G15&gt;, and &lt;GS8&gt; constrain how a Robot can legally rotate the Center Vortex. <br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Rule &lt;G14&gt; prevents a Robot from grasping a Game Element. In the context of Controlling the rotation of the Center Vortex, Robot contact with the Center Vortex PVC vertical pole from two or more different directions in the horizontal plane is not allowed. For example, a spinning wheel touching the Center Vortex vertical support is allowed, if it does not damage the PVC vertical pole. Using two or more spinning wheels that interact with the PVC vertical pole from different directions in the horizontal plane violates rule &lt;G14&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-24-2016, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: What is the definition of an open recycling system?<br />
Question 2: What is the definition of a closed recycling system?<br />
Answer 1: Open Recycling System - All Robots participating in a Match have a reasonable opportunity to interact with Scored Particles that have randomly returned from a Vortex to the Playing Field Floor.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Closed Recycling System - One or more cycles of (1) Scoring, (2) capturing, and (3) re-Scoring a Particle in a manner that denies the other Robots in a Match an equal opportunity to capture a just Scored Particle. The following videos of prototype Robots are examples of Closed Recycling Systems for the Corner Vortex.<br />
<br />
i) https://youtu.be/FqhtXVk1eZM?t=5m45s - 5 minutes and 45 seconds into the video.<br />
ii) https://youtu.be/5FPnng5BVdg<br />
<br />
Robots or game play strategies that have any of the following characteristics are considered to be using a Closed Recycling System:<br />
i)  A Robot created confined area that corrals Scored Particles as they exit a Vortex. This is considered a barrier that restricts access to other Robots.<br />
<br />
ii) A mechanism that reduces the randomness of where Scored Particles return to the Playing Field Floor.<br />
<br />
iii) Controlling a Scored Particle before it contacts the Playing Field Floor or Center Vortex Base.<br />
<br />
Closed Recycling Systems for Scoring any quantity of Particles in the Corner Vortex and/or Center Vortex are not allowed.<br />
<br />
Alliance Partners giving their permission to use a Closed Recycling System does not make a Closed Recycling System legal.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Do not parse the game rules and the Game Design Committee's posts in the Game Q&amp;A Forum in an attempt to find a legal ambiguity that justifies a Closed Recycling System for Scoring Particles. The Game Design Committee's intent is simple, all Scored Particles should return without restriction to random locations [subject to the design of the Vortex Particle return mechanisms] on the Playing Field Floor and both Robots on an Alliance should have an equal opportunity to access, Control, or Possess their Alliance's just Scored Particles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;G14&gt; states that Robots cannot grasp, grab or attach to a Game Element. <br />
 <br />
Question: Is a &quot;U shaped&quot; alignment tool thats fits on either side of the Beacon [it might touch the sides of the Beacon] allowed?<br />
Answer: Yes, provided that the alignment tool does not damage the Beacon and no other rule is violated. For example, Robot contact with anything outside the Playing Field Perimeter violates rule &lt;S2&gt;.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: The alignment tool should not extend far enough past the Beacon so that it could contact a volunteer standing near the Playing Field Perimeter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can the GDC clarify their Tip in post #3 in &quot;Miscellaneous Game Questions - Answer Thread&quot;<br />
Question: My builders want to touch the Center Vortex PVC vertical pole with a timing belt stretched between 2 pulleys.  Their thought is that if the timing belt wraps the pole less than 180 degrees, that this would not violate &lt;G14&gt;, since it would not grab, grasp or attach itself to the pole.<br />
Answer: The action described violates rule &lt;G14&gt;. The timing belt's multiple points of contact around the PVC vertical pole is considered to be grasping the Game Element.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Playing Field Floor is defined as &quot;The surface of the tiles that make up the base of the Playing Field.&quot; From this definition, the black base of the Center Vortex is not part of the Playing Field Floor.<br />
<br />
&lt;GS2&gt; says in part &quot;After Scoring, Particles must make contact with the Playing Field Floor before they are eligible to be Scored again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: May robots pick up Particles from the black base of the Center Vortex and score them without violating &lt;GS2&gt; or must the Particles touch a floor tile first?  In other words, should the black base be considered part of the Playing Field Floor for purposes of &lt;GS2&gt; or not?<br />
Answer: Great question! Robots may collect Particles from the Center Vortex Base and legally Score them without violating rule &lt;GS2&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post 4 in the Miscellaneous Game Questions Answer Thread states that<br />
<br />
&quot;Robots or game play strategies that have any of the following characteristics are considered to be using a Closed Recycling System: ... ii) A mechanism that reduces the randomness of where Scored Particles return to the Playing Field Floor&quot; and &quot;all Scored Particles should return without restriction to random locations [subject to the design of the Vortex Particle return mechanisms] on the Playing Field Floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: We were wondering if the following two strategies are legal. Note that we have a very consistent launcher -- all particles launched from a certain position on the field will follow the same trajectory. Consider a cycle to be the release / scoring of multiple particles that were stored in our robot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pseudo pseudo closed recycling&quot; (Strategy A): Line up semi-randomly on the field such that particles launched will land somewhere in the center vortex. Given the extreme consistency of our launcher, the particles launched (in a given cycle) will land in the same section of the center vortex and thus land in the same area of the field. However, due to semi-random lineup, the area of the field in which the particles land -- out of seven possible areas -- was not predetermined and will likely differ for each separate cycle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pseudo closed recycling&quot; (Strategy B): Line up on the field such that particles launched will land in a predetermined section of the center vortex (every cycle will launch to this section) and thus land in the same area of the field, every cycle.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
Answer: Both strategies are allowed. <br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: The Game Design Committee's intent is for Robots to launch, push, place, etc. Particles into a Vortex (Center or Corner Vortex&#8203; as appropriate) and then collect the just Scored Particles by driving as needed to the location where the Particles naturally return to the Playing Field Floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Game Manual Part 2 it states the following as it relates to scoring particles:<br />
<br />
Particle Scoring &#8211; Particles Scored into an Alliance-specific Center Vortex earn five (5) points each for the corresponding Alliance (regardless of Particle color. Particles Scored into the Alliance-specific Corner Vortex earn one (1) point each for the corresponding Alliance (regardless of Particle color).<br />
<br />
The language is similar for both autonomous and driver controlled periods. <br />
 <br />
Question: Is this to be read as teams can purposely score any color particle in their corner vortex and/or center vortex (ie, red gathering blue particles to score) or is this meant to address inadvertent scoring only (ie, red throws a red particle into a blue vortex).  We ask for clarification and more specific verbiage indicating that alliances are only allowed to control particles of their alliance color or that alliances can control particles of any color for scoring.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: Rule &lt;GS10&gt; states that Robots may not Control or Block Access to the opposing Alliance's Cap Ball or Particles. Therefore, Robots cannot legally attempt to Score the opposing Alliance's Scoring Elements.<br />
<br />
The Particle Scoring text from the Game Manual that is referenced in the team's question, allows Robots to intentionally or inadvertently Score their Alliance's Particles in the opposing Alliance's Vortex goals. When counting Scored Particles, the Alliance goal is what matters, not which Alliance's Particle entered the goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Are robots allowed to score multiple particles together at the same time? For example, can you build an arm to attach to the robot to grab 2 or 3 particles and then score them together.<br />
Answer: Yes, Robots are allowed to Score multiple Particles together at the same time. Rule &lt;GS1&gt; allows Robots to Control or Possess any quantity of their Alliance's Particles once the Match begins.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: The question references building an arm to collect Particles and then Score them. If the intent is to use the arm to Score Particles in the Center Vortex, rule &lt;GS8&gt; prevents Robots from extending higher than 29 inches (73.6 cm), except during the End Game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to &lt;GS2&gt; After Scoring, Particles must make contact with the Playing Field Floor before they are eligible to be Scored again. Any Particles Scored in violation of this rule will have a Score value of zero<br />
<br />
Question 1: May the particles touch the robot (or any part thereof) prior to making contact the Playing Field floor?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Can robots be designed to help direct particles returning from the Center or Corner Vortices toward itself, as long as the particle makes contact with the playing field floor before being possessed and scored?<br />
Answer 1: Yes, inadvertent contact with a Robot is allowed. Robots may not Possess or Control a just Scored Particle before the Particle contacts the Playing Field Floor or the Center Vortex Base.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: No, this is considered to be Controlling a Particle and it is not allowed until after the Particle makes contact with the Playing Field Floor or the Center Vortex Base. See post #4 in the &quot;Miscellaneous Game Questions - Answer Thread&quot; for the complete details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team was thinking of using a barrier to manipulate the direction of the particles scored in the corner vortex. This would ensure that all the particles end up on the same side, which would save us a lot of time.<br />
<br />
Question: Is this strategy legal?<br />
 <br />
Our idea would basically consist of some sort of barrier attached to our robot. The barrier would not be in contact with the floor. <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: This strategy was declared to be illegal in the &quot;Miscellaneous Game Questions - Answer Thread,&quot; post #4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-29-2016, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suppose a robot on alliance A is spinning the center vortex, and a robot on alliance B comes over and either applies something to spin it the other direction, or applies friction to bring it to a stop. <br />
<br />
Question: If in this struggle for controlling the rotation of the center vortex, it ends up breaking, which alliance is assessed a penalty?<br />
Answer: The Penalized Robot is not based on when it started to interact with the Center Vortex. Referees observing the Match will make the determination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-29-2016, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suppose robot A is attempting to score the cap ball on the center vortex. A robot on the other alliance spins the center vortex around and knocks it into robot A, causing it to tip over.<br />
<br />
Question: Is the robot that spun the center vortex assessed a penalty for tipping over robot A?<br />
Answer: Strategies aimed solely at tipping over an opposing Alliance Robot are not allowed per rule &lt;G15&gt;. Intentional interference with a Robot that Possesses a lifted Cap Ball is a violation of rule &lt;GS11&gt;. The action described in the question is a possible violation of rules &lt;G15&gt; and &lt;GS11&gt;. Referees watching the Match will make the determination if a rule has been violated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-29-2016, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two teams on the same alliance are both legally touching the center vortex pole for the purposes of rotating it.<br />
 <br />
Question: Is the combination of the two robots interacting with the center vortex pole considered grasping it?<br />
Answer: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-29-2016, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: If an particle belonging to the opposing alliance drops from the center vortex and lands on top of an opposing alliance, becoming lodged in or on the robot, will this be considered a penalty for controlling a particle of the opposing alliance? <br />
 <br />
Question 2: If it is a penalty, will the team controlling the particle be continually called for penalties until they remove the particle from their robot? <br />
 <br />
Question 3: If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then can the offending team disable their robot to avoid receiving additional penalties.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Answer 1: Yes, this violates rule &lt;GS10&gt;. An Alliance has access to between three and five Particles. Keeping an opposing Alliance's Particle out of play creates a significant competitive advantage.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, Penalties will be assessed as described in rule &lt;GS10&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: No, rule &lt;G23&gt; does not protect a Robot from earring Penalties when it is Disabled for strategic reasons.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Robots should be designed to prevent unintentional Possession of the opposing Alliance's Particles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-29-2016, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: As there are a limited number of possible return paths for a particle that has been scored in the corner vortex, can you define a legal distance that the particle must travel on the floor, or a set time that the particle must be avoided, or a minimum distance that our robot must stay back from the particle return, so that retrieving this particle would be considered &quot;open recycling?&quot;<br />
Answer: No, adding the suggested parameters introduces rule loopholes that could allow Robots to defeat the Game Design Committee's intent for how to legally recycle Particles during game play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-02-2016, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Game Manual Part 1 rule &lt;RG08&gt; states:<br />
<br />
Robots are allowed to launch game Scoring Elements through the air. It is expected that Teams will launch the elements with just enough velocity to score. If the referees feel that a Robot is launching Scoring Elements with excessive velocity that would cause a safety issue if they were to leave the field the Robot will be required to be inspected. Robots must then demonstrate that a launched Game Element cannot travel in the air more than a distance of 4.88 m (16 ft.) or more than 1.83 m (6 ft.) in elevation.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
The wording of this rule seems to indicate that it is perfectly legal to launch particles in excess of the maximum 16 feet distance and 6 feet elevation, as long as the referees feel that the launching of the particles is responsible and does not pose any safety issues. Our team currently launch particles nearly straight up from under the center vortex. At the top of the slow arch, the ball reaches a height of 6 feet 6 inches. We just want to clarify the intent of the game design committee in regards to this rule.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: The Game Design Committee's intent is for a launched Particle to travel in the air no more than a distance of 4.88 m (16 ft.) and/or no more than 1.83 m (6 ft.) in elevation. Robots may not legally launch Particles further or higher than these limits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-04-2016, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Teams have shared in the Game Q&amp;A forum their strong belief that allowing Robots to rotate the Center Vortex breaks the game and the Game Design Committee should proclaim that purposeful rotation of the Center Vortex is not allowed. The Game Design Committee believes this is a valid concern and we would like to share our perspective with the FIRST Tech Challenge community.<br />
<br />
During the game design process, we considered the difficulty level of rotating the Center Vortex, the strategic benefit of the action, and how easily an opposing Alliance Robot could disrupt the strategy. <br />
<br />
It is a difficult task: We believe that the constraints placed on how Robots may legally interact with the Center Vortex prevent Robots from rotating the Center Vortex at an angular rate that will break the game. Referees will pay close attention to how Robots interact with the Center Vortex to assure that there is no damage and Robot mechanisms do not employ multiple points of contact that grab, grasp, pinch, etc. the Center Vortex PVC Vertical Pole. <br />
<br />
Limited strategic value: Rotating the Center Vortex affects both Alliances, reducing the strategic value of this strategy. A Robot that is rotating the Center Vortex is probably not able to concurrently add to the Alliance&#8217;s Score. Finally, rotating the Center Vortex during the End Game while an opposing Alliance Robot is attempting to Score a Cap Ball in the Center Vortex violates the Cap Ball interference rule, &lt;GS11&gt;.<br />
<br />
Easy to disrupt the strategy: It should be easy for an opposing Alliance Robot to disrupt the strategy by pushing the Robot away from the Center Vortex.<br />
<br />
At this point in the season, the Game Design Committee believes that allowing the purposeful rotation of the Center Vortex is a valid game activity that is difficult to perform, has limited strategic value, and is easily defended against. However, FIRST Tech Challenge teams are extremely creative and they have surprised the Game Design Committee with their ingenious Robot designs and strategies in the past. For example, in the game Bowled Over, the Game Design Committee was pleasantly surprised that Robots lifted the Scoring Crates so high that referees needed a ladder to measure their height!<br />
<br />
The Game Design Committee will continue to allow the purposeful rotation of the Center Vortex until there is evidence that the strategy really does break the game. If a Robot demonstrates that the strategy does break the game, the Game Design Committee will probably fix the game with a ruling in the Game Q&amp;A Forum.<br />
<br />
The questions and comments made by Teams in the Q&amp;A Game Form have made the Game Design Committee concerned that vigorous rotation of the Center Vortex is likely and it may cause damage. In many cases, the damage will be visible and an obvious violation of the Playing Field damage rule, &lt;S1&gt;. Less obvious internal damage or accelerated wear and tear from fast rotation rates and the high forces needed to rotate the Center Vortex make it difficult for referees at different events to make the same judgment call. To help assure consistency between tournaments, the Game Design Committee is providing the following guidance to determine when the Center Vortex rotation rate violates rule &lt;S1&gt;: <br />
<br />
i) A Robot that purposefully causes the Center Vortex to rotate at a rate of one revolution in less than five seconds violates rule &lt;S1&gt;.<br />
ii) A complete revolution of the Center Vortex at a high angular rate is not required to violate rule &lt;S1&gt;.<br />
iii) Similar to the other rules that have a time component, the perceived rotation rate will be a judgment call by referees. Timing aids such as a stopwatch will not be used to precisely determine the rotation rate.<br />
<br />
Teams that plan on intentionally rotating the Center Vortex should carefully review rule &lt;S1&gt; and pay close attention to the &quot;intent&quot; statement that is part of the rule. When a referee warns a Drive Team that their Robot is damaging the Center Vortex, the Robot should immediately stop interacting with the Center Vortex and move away. <br />
<br />
That's all for now,<br />
<br />
The Game Design Committee</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-06-2016, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal to push an opposing alliance robot while it's launching particles into the center vortex?<br />
Answer: Yes, provided that no other rule is violated. For example, Drive Teams using aggressive actions against an opposing Alliance Robot should have a clear understanding of the Unsafe Robot and and Playing Field Damage rule, &lt;S1&gt;. If the opposing Alliance Robot is launching Particles towards a Vortex, the Particle interference rule &lt;GS9&gt; could come into play. Drive Teams should also be careful not to violate the Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking Robots rule, &lt;G16&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Are we then allowed to send the particles 94 inches above the floor?<br />
Answer: The 6 ft (1.83 m) elevation constraint in rule &lt;RG08&gt; is measured from the Playing Field Floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: If a particle is lodged between the pvc pipes of the center vortex, is it counted as scored?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Based on previous seasons, a stuck scoring element is still up to the teams to dislodge?<br />
Answer 1: No, the definition of Scored in section 1.4 of the Game Manual Part 2 requires that a Particle &quot;roll through the [Center] Vortex&quot; to be Scored. Particles are counted as Scored after they exit through the bottom spokes of the Center Vortex.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: If a robot launches a particle into an opposing alliance robot, does this violate GS10? Thank you!<br />
Answer: Rule &lt;G17&gt; protects a Robot from receiving &lt;GS10&gt; Penalties if the intent of the opposing Alliance is to place, launch, etc. a Particle into the Robot.<br />
<br />
&lt;GS10&gt; Penalties will come into play if a Particle that is launched with the expectation that it will Score into a Vortex becomes embedded in an opposing Alliance's Robot. For example, if a Red Alliance Robot launches a red Particle towards the Center Vortex on a trajectory that has a reasonable chance of Scoring and the Particle falls into a Blue Alliance Robot, the Blue Alliance Robot is subject to &lt;GS10&gt; Penalties.</div></div><hr />

Answer: Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-31-2016, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were wondering if GS10 could be clarified through examples.<br />
<br />
Our robot is designed to detect the color of a particle we unintentionally collect.<br />
Scenario 1) The robot is designed to automatically eject particles of the wrong color out the side of the robot without reversing collection. This would be the fastest way to return an accidentally collected particle to play.<br />
Scenario 2) The robot is designed to automatically reverse the collection mechanism (eject the particle out the front) if the wrong color particle is collected. This would also return the particle to play very quickly. <br />
Scenario 3) Same as scenario 1, but the driver controls this, rather than the robot being designed to handle it automatically. This would slow down the returning of the particle to play.<br />
Scenario 4) Same as scenario 2, but the driver controls this, rather than the robot being designed to handle it automatically. This would slow down the returning of the particle to play.<br />
Note that for all scenarios, the robot operators are actively trying to avoid collecting the wrong colored particle, the functions are just a backup to try to prevent penalty. The intent of the design is to immediately lose possesion of the other alliance's particle.<br />
In these scenarios, would there be penalties, and if so how would the penalties be assessed?<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer: All four scenarios are examples of Controlling an opposing Alliance's Scoring Element. As stated in rule &lt;GS10&gt;, the first instance will result in a warning with any following violations resulting in a Major Penalty and an additional Minor Penalty assessed for every five seconds that the rule violation persists. The ability to quickly discard an opposing Alliance's Particles may reduce the magnitude of &lt;GS10&gt; Penalties, however, it does not give a Robot immunity from rule &lt;GS10&gt; consequences.</div></div><hr />

Question: Does the 20 points still score?  If scoring is not determined instantaneously, please expand on timing of how scoring determinations are made.<br />
Answer: As stated in rule &lt;G12&gt;, referees will determine the Score value of the Cap Ball after it has come to rest.

Blocking and Trapping means denying ALL access, so general Robot movement with respect to other Robots should not be considered in violation unless there is no other way to traverse the Playing Field or get the Scoring Element. Also note that this rule requires attempted action on the part of the opposing Alliance. See also Rule &lt;G16&gt;.&quot;<br />
<br />
In forum post Misc #25, situations that constitute controlling game elements are outlined. However, at our first tournament, the refs interpreted the forum ruling as defining the intent of rule &lt;GS10&gt; to include ANY control of game elements, not just when an opposing robot is attempting access. <br />
<br />
Question: Is the intent of the GDC to penalize any intentional or inadvertent control of game elements, regardless of any attempt of the opposing alliance to actually use said game elements?<br />
Answer: Yes, rule &lt;GS10&gt; consequences come into play any time that a Robot Controls an opposing Alliance Particle or Cap Ball. The portion of the rule that states, &quot;violating the rule requires attempted action on the part of the opposing Alliance&quot; refers only to the Blocking aspect of the rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-15-2016, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were at a tournament, when something unusual occurred.  A team was lifting the cap ball during the end game, when it rolled off their lift above the center vortex, bounced across the field and out over the field perimeter walls.  The ball bounced into the alliance station, where it knocked over the stand for the phones/controllers.  This caused the team's phones to disconnect and they couldn't finish the end game. No penalties were applied and the referees considered it an accidental/incidental event and it didn't change the outcome of the match. <br />
 <br />
Question: Should have the referees handled the situation differently?<br />
Answer: Rule &lt;G25&gt; states that Matches are replayed at the discretion of the Head Referee only for a failure of a Game Element or verified Wi-Fi interference that was likely to have impacted which Alliance won the Match. The scenario described in the question did not satisfy the requirements for a Match replay. Based on the description of the event, the Head Referee followed the correct procedure for determining Penalties, and if a Match replay is allowed and necessary.<br />

<br />
We are hearing reports of teams driving their robots aggressively and repeatedly making very hard contact on the Beacons and the walls adjacent to the Beacons.<br />
<br />
Aggressive contact that causes significant flexing of the walls or moves/dislodges a Beacon will be considered field damage and penalized according to &lt;G15&gt;.  Teams should expect to receive warnings and may receive Major Penalties and a Yellow Card for excessive or chronic aggressive Beacon contacts.</div></div><hr />

At a recent league event, the center vortex was rotated faster than 12 RPM by a robot acting against a Cap Ball resting on the center vortex base. By squeezing the Cap Ball against the center vortex vertical pole and turning, the robot easily rotated the center vortex. The action is recorded in the video: https://youtu.be/dA21DRZmIHw (https://youtu.be/dA21DRZmIHw)<br />
<br />
Question 1: Is this action legal?<br />
Question 2: Does it make a difference if the action is inadvertent?<br />
Answer 1: The Robot action described in the scenario and demonstrated in the video is not allowed if the Center Vortex rotates at a rate that is greater than one revolution in less than five seconds. This is only one example of of a Robot rotating the Center Vortex. Other similar methods that cause a high rotation rate will also be deemed illegal.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Inadvertent rotation of the Center Vortex above the allowed rotation rate should not be Penalized. Referees will determine if the Robot's actions are an intentional strategy or an Inadvertent action.</div></div><hr />

It is very similar to this robot design https://youtu.be/ue3FCX6Itew for the 2012-2013 Ring It Up! game except we raise our scissor extension up higher and we do not have slack wires ever (The wires are secured directly to the metal scissor extension bars). Our plan is to bring the minibot back to the mainbot and stop using it as soon as anyone raises to the height of our scissor extension, to prevent tipping both their robot and our robot from tipping over. <br />
 <br />
Question 1: Right now, we are using the minibot just to help pickup particles and bring them to the mainbot to be launched, is this legal? <br />
 <br />
Question 2: We are also considering adding a beacon button pusher to it so it can help us claim the beacons during end game and autonomous, is this legal?  <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: The Game Design Committee enjoys seeing how Teams solve the annual game challenge and this Robot is a very creative approach to playing VELOCITY VORTEX. <br />
<br />
The Game Design Committee is not able to give absolute approval to the Robot without an in-person inspection. A Robot Inspector at an event will confirm that the Robot complies with all the construction rules. All that the Game Design Committee can say is that in general, the mini-bot/main-Robot concept described in the post does not appear to violate any construction rules. Keep in mind that the entire Robot must comply with the Robot starting volume rule, &lt;G3&gt;.<br />
<br />
While the construction of the Robot appears to be legal, compliance with game rules will be decided by referees during Match play. Complying with the following game rules could be more challenging for this Robot than it is for a more conventional Robot design.<br />
<br />
&lt;S1&gt; Unsafe Robot<br />
&lt;G15&gt; Destruction, Damage, Tipping, etc.<br />
&lt;G13&gt; Robots Deliberately Detaching Parts<br />
&lt;G16&gt; Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking Robots<br />
&lt;G20&gt; Timely removal of Robots from the Playing Field at the end of a Match<br />
&lt;GS9&gt; Particle interference<br />
&lt;GS10&gt; Blocking Access to an opposing Alliance's Scoring Elements<br />
&lt;GS11&gt; Cap Ball interference<br />
<br />
Blocking Robots, Scoring Elements, and launched Particles are of particular concern. A Robot this big could be a real barrier to allowing free access to Particles, Cap Balls, and Vortex goals.<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;G13&gt; is also a major issue. Robot parts that are released but remain connected by a tether and interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot are considered detached for the purpose of this rule. If the mini-bot or connecting scissor extension interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot, a Major Penalty and a Yellow Card will be issued.<br />
<br />
Finally, for your consideration, how will the mini-bot and rigid scissor extension hold up against a Robot playing defense directly against the mini-bot? FIRST Tech Challenge games are highly interactive; Robot-to-Robot contact and defensive game play should be expected. Is the mini-bot and scissor extension robust enough to survive a push or impact from another Robot?<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Answer #1 also applies to Question #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-12-2016, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding our cap ball lifting mechanism, our robot uses the side of the playing field to lock a door hinge that would allow the mechanism to lift the ball. The arm goes outside the playing field, but it does not make contact with anything on the outside. There's a rule in the game manual that states that the robot cannot make contact anything outside the playing field; however, it does not touch anything outside the field. <br />
<br />
Question: Would we be allowed to use the side of the playing field to lock the mechanism, so we could lift the ball?<br />
Answer: The intent of rule &lt;S2&gt; is to prevent penalizing Inadvertent safe Robot extension outside the Playing Field Perimeter. To keep the rule simple, the Game Design Committee selected contact with something outside the Playing Field Perimeter to determine if the extension is unsafe. The Robot's actions described in the question violate rule &lt;S2&gt; because it is a planned extension outside of the Playing Field Perimeter that is a safety risk for referees standing nearby.</div></div><hr />

Answer: A Robot that drags a cable around the Playing Field Floor is an entanglement risk and is not allowed by rule &lt;G15&gt;.<br />
 <br />
Additional concerns include:<br />
1) Particles and Cap Balls drug by the tether would be considered Controlled.<br />
2) Rule &lt;G13&gt; consequences of a Major Penalty and Yellow Card will be issued if a mini-bot or the tether affects game play by an opposing Alliance Robot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Answer: In general, deliberate means &quot;with intent&quot; and chronic means &quot;repeated numerous times&quot;. i.e. we use standard definitions.<br />
<br />
For &lt;G15&gt; to apply, referees are looking for contact that is clearly part of a strategy to destroy/damage/tip/entangle game elements or opposing alliance robots.  Repeated, hard contact that is outside of the course of normal game play may be an indication that &lt;G15&gt; may apply. Simply making contact with a robot while playing defense is not enough by itself to justify a penalty under &lt;G15&gt;. <br />

<br />
Question 1: Is a sort-of ramp allowed on the top of the Robot to direct any balls that fall on top of it to fall behind the robot? <br />
<br />
Question 2: If using a very accurate launcher to consistently score in the same position in the vortex allowing the ball to always fall in approximately the same location (this has been clarified as legal), are we allowed to have the balls fall on said ramp, essentially rolling down right behind the robot?<br />
<br />
Question 3: If the situation addressed in question 2 is legal, would we be allowed to open up a net in order to cover a larger area, and have the net direct the balls onto the ramp, eventually rolling down right in front of the robot?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Answer 1: The Robot construction rules in the Game Manual Part 1 do not prohibit ramps. From a game rule standpoint, it depends on how the ramp is used during a Match. The referees will determine if: 1) the ramp reduces the randomness of where Scored Particles return to the Playing Field Floor or, 2) if the ramp is used to Control a Scored Particle before it contacts the Playing Field Floor or Center Vortex Base. A ramp that performs either of these functions is not allowed. A sloped surface that is intended to prevent Inadvertently Possessing a Particle inside the Robot structure is allowed.<br />
<br />
See posts #2, #4, and #11 in the &quot;Miscellaneous Game Questions - Answer Thread&quot; for guidance concerning Closed Recycling Systems.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: See Answer #1.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: Opening a net to cover a larger area is not allowed because it is intended to Control a Scored Particle before it contacts the Playing Field Floor or Center Vortex Base.</div></div><hr />

Answer: Yes, rule &lt;G16&gt; is violated if an opposing Alliance Robot attempts to access the Blocked Beacon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-09-2017, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many robots have difficulty claiming beacons if there is a particle against the wall and directly in front of the beacon.  There's plenty of precedent in matches that I've seen for pushing opposing alliance's particles out of the way to gain access to beacons.  However, this might be considered deliberate control of the particles and not permitted under &lt;GS10&gt; (&quot;plowing&quot; specifies that the contact be inadvertent).<br />
<br />
Question 1: Can you confirm that such limited deliberate movement of opposing alliance's particles is permitted (as you have previously allowed momentarily pushing the opposing alliance's cap ball to gain access to particles)?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Does that equally apply to a robot whose motion sweeps the area in front of the beacon in autonomous.<br />
<br />
Question 3: As there is no restriction on the shape of a robot after the start of a match, does that permit extending an arm to sweep the area in front of the beacon, in driver controlled or in autonomous?<br />

What (if any) penalty would be assessed and to which robot? Thank you for your time!<br />
Answer: In general, Robots should be designed to withstand expected Robot-to-Robot contact and Robots should be operated so that they don't intentionally damage another Robot. Referees will determine if the Robot-to-Robot contact was inadvertent, intentional, avoidable, etc. and if the damaged Robot was an entanglement or safety risk. Appropriate consequences will be applied based on the Robot behaviors and risk factors. If the entanglement or damage is ruled to be deliberate or chronic, the offending Team will receive a Major Penalty and a Yellow Card.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Question 2: Are teams allowed to score those unintentionally and inadvertently possessed Particles in their own Vortex(s) without penalty and with reward?<br />
<br />
Scenario: A blue alliance robot launches a blue Particle at the blue Center Vortex. The Particle misses and lands in the launcher of an Opposing Alliance robot.  That robot then launches the blue particle through their alliance&#8217;s red Center Vortex.<br />
<br />
Question 3: Is the Major Penalty under &lt;GS10&gt; assessed immediately and regardless of whether or not the control of the particle is inadvertent or on purpose?<br />

Question 4: Does the blue Particle count as Scored in the red Center Vortex?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: No, per rule &lt;GS10&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The opposing Alliance's Particle is eligible for Scoring and rule &lt;GS10&gt; consequences come into play because an opposing Alliance Particle is Possessed. <br />

We are considering having our mainbot (the one with the shooter) park in the correct center vortex goal scoring location, then have the minibot bring the balls back to it.  <br />
<br />
Question 1: Is there any rule preventing an opposing alliance team from just sitting in front of the mainbot sweeper for the entire game to prevent the minibot from giving balls to the mainbot?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If the answer to the above question is no, is there any rule the would prevent a fast, maneuverable robot from staying in front of a &quot;normal&quot; robots sweeper while they move around the field to prevent them from gathering any balls?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: In general, the defensive Robot is not violating a rule. Rule &lt;GS10&gt; does not come into play because the main-bot via the mini-bot is Controlling or Possessing the affected Particles. Rule &lt;G16&gt; would come into play if the defensive Robot Pins or Traps the offensive Robot.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: A defensive Robot shadowing an offensive Robot as described in the question is Blocking Access to Particles, a violation of rule &lt;GS10&gt;. If the shadowing defensive Robot is deemed to be herding the Particles, they could also be guilty of rule &lt;GS10&gt; for control of opposing Alliance Game Elements.</div></div><hr />

The protected area is the area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Does this violate any rules?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Same as the scenario, except the blue alliance robot is in the protected area around the beacon before the red robot arrives. The red alliance robot pushes the blue alliance robot sideways away from the beacon and parks in front of the opposing alliance's beacon. Is this allowed?<br />
<br />
Question 3: Same as the scenario, except the blue alliance robot is in the protected area around the beacon before the red robot arrives. The red alliance robot pins the blue alliance robot against the playing field perimeter wall, preventing the blue alliance robot from triggering their beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 1: The Red Alliance Robot's actions are allowed if a Blue Alliance Robot does not attempt to access the Blue Alliance Beacon that is Blocked by the Red Alliance Robot. Rule &lt;G16&gt; consequences come into play if the Blue Alliance Robot attempts to access the Blocked Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, the action is allowed if the Blue Alliance Robot is not attempting to drive back to access the Beacon while the Red Alliance Robot is inside the protected Area in front the Beacon. Rule &lt;G16&gt; is violated if the Blue Alliance Robot attempts to maneuver back to the Beacon and it is Blocked by a Red Alliance Robot that is In the protected Area in front of the Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: The Red Alliance Robot's actions violate rule &lt;G16&gt; for Pinning if the referee determines that it is a deliberate strategy. The Red Alliance Robot having performed this maneuver during several preceding Matches will influence the referee's determination of the Robot's intended strategy for the current Match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-15-2017, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Can a team be penalized for speeding?<br />
Answer: The game rules do not specifically restrict Robot speed. Rule &lt;S1&gt; consequences will come into play if a referee deems that a Robot's operation is unsafe.<br />
<br />
In the off chance that the question is about a Team speeding, for safety reasons, rule &lt;T21&gt; prevents Teams from running in the venue. Rule &lt;G26&gt; consequences for egregious behavior will come into play if Team representatives continue to &quot;speed&quot; in the venue after a warning is issued by a tournament official.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: At what point is bashing into a beacon considered a penalty?<br />
<br />
I know there has been extreme emphasis in this case but it has never been specifically addressed as to whether teams need to have a mechanism to push the beacons or if bashing into them is a legal strategy.<br />
<br />
Answer: Robot actions, not Robot design, determines if rule &lt;G15&gt; is violated while interacting with a Beacon. There is no Robot design that is immune from incurring rule &lt;G15&gt; consequences for overly aggressive interaction with a Beacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miscellaneous Game Questions - Answer Thread&quot; post #33 addresses the &quot;point that Bashing into a Beacon is considered a Penalty.&quot; This post states in part, that aggressive contact that causes significant flexing of the walls or moves/dislodges a Beacon will be considered field damage and Penalized according to &lt;G15&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a scenario at a tournament, where all 5 red particles rolled to a corner of the perimeter, one of the blue alliance robots was disabled right in front of the corner, this essentially made all 5 red particles inaccessible. <br />
<br />
Question: Is this just bad luck or is the blocking access to an opposing alliance's scoring elements rule violated?<br />
Answer: Rule &lt;G23&gt; protects a Disabled Robot (whether referee induced or Robot failure) from receiving Penalties. Rule &lt;GS10&gt; consequences should not come into play if the referee determines that the Blue Alliance Robot is Disabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's say a robot is designed to play only Cap Ball lifting at the end game, so for the one and half minutes in the match, this robot decided to play heavy defense, and kept chasing opponent robots, pushing, trapping, pinning them, to the degree that opponent robots could not play the game.<br />
<br />
Question: Does this break any rule?<br />
Answer: Drive Teams are allowed to engage their Robots in defensive strategies. Numerous rules constrain defensive actions performed by Robots. Drive Teams that play defense should have a thorough understanding of the rules that are most likely to come into play (e.g., &lt;S1&gt;, &lt;G15&gt;, &lt;G16&gt;, &lt;G26&gt;, &lt;GS7&gt;, &lt;GS9&gt;, &lt;GS10&gt;, &lt;GS11&gt;, &lt;GS12&gt;, &lt;GS13&gt;, and &lt;GS14&gt;).<br />
<br />
Most of the example Robot actions in the question are addressed in rule &lt;G16&gt;. If a referee determines this rule is violated, the offending Alliance will receive a Minor Penalty for every five seconds that they are in violation. If a referee declares a Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking warning during the Match, the offending Robot(s) must move away at least 0.9 m (3 feet) from the Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked Robot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still need a little more clarification on defensive moves, sorry.  &lt;G16&gt; appears to allow pinning, trapping and blocking for up to 5 seconds.  Trying to be very direct:<br />
<br />
Question 1: Can a robot directly block access to an opposing alliance's beacon for less than 5 seconds, without incurring a penalty, even if an opposing alliance's robot is attempting to score at that beacon?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Can a robot push an opposing alliance's robot away from a beacon it is trying to score on without incurring a penalty?  This assumes that the push is of reasonable intensity and not likely to harm a well-built robot.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Answer 1: Yes.<br />
<br />

When the robot is set on the field for game play and the robot is initialized, if a servo moving to an initialization point makes a part extend beyond the 18&quot; x 18&quot; x 18&quot;, is that ok?<br />
<br />
A: The Robot must remain within the 18&quot; x 18&quot; x 18&quot; configuration until the start of the match.  A Robot that extends beyond this configuration when Initialized is not legal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer: Per &lt;G25&gt; there are two conditions that must both be met for a match replay to be granted<br />
<br />
 A failure of a Game Element or verified Wi-Fi interference<br />
 An impact that is likely to have affected which Alliance won the Match<br />

<br />
<br />
The failure described does not satisfy condition #1 and does not warrant a match replay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-30-2017, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have some questions about rule &lt;G8&gt; which says in part:<br />
&quot;Robots that do not stop playing the game at the end of the Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Periods when competition personnel or timer software announce the end of a Match period receive a Minor Penalty and the actions of the Robot occurring after the end of a Match period do not count towards their Alliance’s Score. Referees have the option of issuing a Major Penalty in place of the Minor Penalty if the late stop results in a competitive advantage (other than Scoring) for the offending Alliance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 1: Does this rule mean that if a robot stops game play late and scores after the end of the match, they will be assessed only a minor penalty and the scoring will not count?<br />
Question 2: Can you give some more specifics and/or examples of competitive advantages other than scoring? We are having difficulty coming up with any.<br />
Answer 1: Yes.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The general game rules (&lt;Gn&gt;) are written to be non-game specific so that they can be reused from season to season with few or no changes. For this season's game, there are not many non-Scoring Robot actions after the end of a period that produce a competitive advantage. For VELOCITY VORTEX, the act of Possessing additional Particles after the end of the Autonomous Period gives an Alliance a non-Scoring competitive advantage for the start of the Driver-Controlled Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-30-2017, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are using a flywheel to launch particles into the center vortex. A DC motor gradually builds up rotational inertia in the flywheel and the flywheel's inertia launches the particles.  <br />
<br />
The motor controller has the option of either floating/coasting the motor to a stop or suddenly braking the motor to a stop. Selecting the brake option means that calling SetPower(0.0) on the DC motor will force the DC motor to suddenly absorb the inertia stored up in the flywheel. To avoid this stress on the DC motor, we select the float option.  <br />
<br />
Question: Is there a penalty if a flywheel continues rotating after the end of a match as it coasts to a stop?<br />
Answer: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-31-2017, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A red alliance robot goes behind the blue alliance cap ball while chasing red particles. The red alliance robot unintentionally picks up a blue particle that they did not see behind the cap ball in the process. Because the robot is beyond the view of the drivers (behind the cap ball), it takes 6 to 8 seconds for the team to realize that they picked up the blue particle and eject it.<br />
<br />
Question: How is rule &lt;GS10&gt; applied?<br />
Answer: The Drive Team should, if possible, immediately stop violating rule &lt;GS10&gt; upon receiving a warning from a referee. If the Robot has not stopped Controlling the opposing Alliance's Particle after a five second period following a warning from a referee has passed, the escalation path should be followed and a Major Penalty assessed. An additional Minor Penalty should be assessed for each additional five second period that the violation continues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Playing Field Floor is defined as &quot;The surface of the tiles that make up the base of the Playing Field.&quot; From this definition, the black base of the Center Vortex is not part of the Playing Field Floor.<br />
<br />
&lt;GS2&gt; says in part &quot;After Scoring, Particles must make contact with the Playing Field Floor before they are eligible to be Scored again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: May robots pick up Particles from the black base of the Center Vortex and score them without violating &lt;GS2&gt; or must the Particles touch a floor tile first?  In other words, should the black base be considered part of the Playing Field Floor for purposes of &lt;GS2&gt; or not?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Please clarify what the vision patterns under the beacon are for. Also, will they be same for all competitions?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: Teams may use the Robot Controller Android device camera in conjunction with Vuforia navigation software, which is part of the default software application library for the FIRST Tech Challenge, to determine the Robot's location on the Playing Field when at least one of the Vision Targets is viewed by the camera. This information will help a Robot navigate to a Beacon location during the Autonomous Period.<br />
<br />
The four images in Appendix B of the Game Manual Part 2 will be used at all competitions and they will always be in the same locations on the Playing Field. See the &quot;Field Setup and Configuration Guide&quot; for the locations of the Vision Targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">02-16-2017, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the scenario leading up to our question: <br />
<br />
In one of our matches in autonomous a red alliance robot finished the auto program touching the beacon button with the beacon turned to blue. One the blue alliance one of their robots finished autonomous with their robot touching the beacon button as well and their beacon was turned to blue. As the autonomous timer hit zero a robot ran into the wall and then both of the beacons that were close to the robots on both alliances turned to red. <br />
<br />
The FTA thought maybe the beacons turned from blue to red because of static discharge sent through the beacons. The referee said the match should be scored as is since it should be scored once all game elements come to rest. It ended up being scored as it was with the beacons turned red and they believe the robot that hit the wall caused the beacons to turn since the robots were touching the beacons. <br />
<br />
The question is this:<br />
<br />
In what case is static discharge verifiable where those beacons would have scored as blue instead of red? Would this result in a rerun or is it scored as is since you can't verify 100% for sure static discharge?<br />
<br />
Hi Team 5501, <br />
<br />
It is difficult to make a determination on the scenario you described as we were not present at the event. Based on the scenario described, it sounds like the Head Referee made the correct call, when the 3rd robot hit the wall it caused the wall to flex, pulling the beacons away from the robots and then springing back. This would have caused a legitimate button press on both beacons and changed the color of the beacons.<br />
<br />
The Head Referee would base their response on what they observed on the field. If they feel this wasn’t caused by a failed field element, they will not rerun the match. See rule &lt;G25&gt;:<br />
<br />
&lt;G25&gt;	Match Replay – Matches are replayed at the discretion of the Head Referee only for a failure of a Game Element or verified Wi-Fi interference that was likely to have impacted which Alliance won the Match.<br />
Unexpected Robot behavior in itself will not result in a Match replay. Team-induced failures, such as low battery conditions, processor sleep time-outs, Robot mechanical/electrical/software/communication failures, etc. are NOT valid justifications for a replaying of a Match.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raj</div><div class="date">10-19-2016, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During setup for a game match, teams set opmode for their autonomous program. The “Select OpMode” window easily gets cluttered with numerous autonomous OpModes. One idea the team had was to write a single autonomous OpMode that can be configured with a gamepad during the init phase of the OpMode. Assuming we don’t cause a delay of game, would this be legal for us to do?<br />
A: Yes, you can use the gamepad to select which branch of your Autonomous OpMode you will run for a given match as long as the following remains true: 1) The setting is read in the init() phase; 2) The pressing of the gamepad is done prior to the referees randomizing the beacons; 3) It does not cause a delay in the start of a match; and 4) The only button you press at the beginning of the Autonomous period is the start button on the driver's station Android device.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer: Routine detailed resizing of robots during match setup should not be a normal part of setup.  Referees will be watching for significant violations. Minor concerns will be addressed by sending the robot back to inspection to be appropriately checked for sizing compliance after the match.<br />
<br />
An 18&quot; stick at the field is an OK tool for verifying significant violations, but realistically should not be used to check for &quot;millimeter&quot; compliance. In all cases, the official measure of size compliance is the sizing cube used during Robot Inspection.</div></div><hr />

Question: Does this violate &lt;G4&gt; or any other contest rules?<br />

Thanks<br />
Answer: Using a handheld tape measure as an alignment or positioning aid during pre-Match Robot set up violates rule &lt;G4&gt;. A single degree of freedom tape measure mounted on the Robot may be used if the measuring tape does not extend outside the 45.7cm (18 inch) cube starting volume constraint during the entire set up process.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-22-2016, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 5.3.1 of the Game Manual Part 1 asks teams to reflect on their Robot's design and the question: “If everybody did this, would the game play be impossible? If the answer to the question is yes, the design component is probably not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
VELOCITY VORTEX is played with Particles that are Scored in goals and recycled back to the Playing Field for continuous game play. The Game Design Committee's intent is for open recycling, where Scored Particles return to random locations on the Playing Field Floor so that both Robots on an Alliance have an equal opportunity to access, Control, or Possess their Alliance's Scored Particles. A closed recycling game strategy that denies a reasonable opportunity for an Alliance Partner Robot to access, Control, or Possess a Scored Particle is not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge and is not allowed. Game play with closed recycling of Particles would be impossible and unfair to Alliance Partners. Therefore, Robot designs and/or game strategies that deny their Alliance Partner equal access to Scored Particles, is considered to be a violation of rule &lt;GS2&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-26-2016, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is the robot allowed to press the Beacon Button twice in the Autonomous period in order to correct a mistake? Thanks!<br />
Answer: Yes, the action described is allowed. There is no rule that limits the number of times a Robot may press a Beacon trigger button in the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: To help prevent accidental resetting of a Beacon twice by a button press, there is a built-in five second delay after a button is released before the trigger buttons become active and are able to change the illuminated state of the Beacon again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Are robots required to move before throwing particles into the center vortex during the autonomous period?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: No, Robots are allowed to launch Particles without moving from their Match starting location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: Is it legal for a robot to block the opposing alliance's beacons during the Autonomous Period? We are aware of the rules stating that you may not enter the other side for 10 seconds, and that you may not score the other beacons, but can you block access to them? <br />
<br />
Question 2: If not, could your robot intentionally &quot;sweep&quot; the area to push other robots away from their beacons? We ask as we have seen similar defensive play in autonomous play in previous years.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: Intentional Blocking of an opposing Alliance Robot from accessing their Alliance's Beacon during the Autonomous Period violates rule &lt;G16&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, this is an allowed strategy, provided that the opposing Alliance Robot does not become Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked. See rule &lt;G16&gt; for the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal for drivers to press the stop button on the Driver Station during the Autonomous Period? We realize that teams could strategically stop their robots, but what if the robot starts to cause damage? Are the drivers allowed to prevent damage by stopping the robot midway through the Autonomous Period? Can the drive team ask the referee to be allowed to stop their robot in these kinds of situations?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer: Drive Teams may not stop game play early during the Autonomous Period for strategic reasons. Drive Teams with the cooperation of either a Referee, Field Technical Advisor, or Field Technical Advisor Assistant may press the stop button on the Driver Station if there is unexpected Robot behavior that has or is very likely to damage another Robot, the Playing Field, or the Robot itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-05-2016, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: During autonomous, if our robot picks up the opposing alliance's particles and shoots them into the center vortex, does it count? There is no way during autonomous to intentionally pick up opposing alliance's particles, it has to be accidental, right?<br />
Question 2: Is there a penalty if opposing alliance's particles our robot accidentally picked up remain inside our robot when autonomous is ended?<br />
Answer 1: Yes, Particles Scored during the Autonomous Period into an Alliance-specific Center Vortex earn fifteen points each for the Alliance corresponding to that Vortex, regardless of Particle color and the Alliance Robot that launched the Particle.<br />
<br />
The action described in the question is Controlling an opposing Alliance's Particle and that violates rule &lt;GS10&gt;. After the first warning, a Major Penalty is assessed and an additional Minor Penalty is assessed for every five seconds that the rule violation persists. The rule applies to intentional and accidental Control of the opposing Alliance's Particle.<br />
<br />
Repeated violation of &lt;GS10&gt; could bring the Egragious Behaviour rule ,&lt;G26&gt;, into play for flagrant violation of game rules.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Rule &lt;GS10&gt; is violated in the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods as soon as a Robot Controls the opposing Alliance's Particle. There is no &quot;free pass&quot; to Control an opposing Alliance's Particle during the Autonomous Period. Rule &lt;GS10&gt; Penalties will be assessed during the Autonomous Period and continue during the Driver-Controlled Period until the opposing Alliance's Particle has been released from the Robot.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Turn off the Robot's Particle collection system during the Autonomous Period to avoid violating rule &lt;GS10&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-06-2016, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: During autonomous, after 10 seconds, is it legal to move our robot to just outside of the white gaffe tape, this still gives opposing alliance's robot enough room to access their beacon from other directions if it's programmed to?<br />
<br />
Question 2: During autonomous, after 10 seconds, while our robot is moving towards an opposing alliance's beacon, a few inches away from white gaffe tape line area, collides with opposing alliance's robot, both are stalled afterwards, does it violate blocking, pinning, trapping according rule of G16?<br />
<br />
Question 3: During autonomous, after 10 seconds, is it legal to move our robot to the middle of opposing alliance's two beacons? Is this a blocking access scenario?<br />
<br />
Question 4: Essentially, the question is which area our robot can move to in the opposing alliance side doesn't violate G16?<br />
Answer 1: The action described is legal, if the Robot playing defense is Outside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide gaffers tape.<br />
<br />
Answer 2:  The action described is legal, if the Robot playing defense is Outside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: This is a legal strategy, if the Robot playing defense is Outside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape when an opposing Alliance Robot attempts to access the Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 4: It is a &lt;G16&gt; rule violation for Blocking, if a Robot is attempting to access its Alliance's Beacon and an opposing Alliance Robot is Inside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Triggering the Beacon is a high value achievement during the Autonomous Period. The game rules were written to protect Robots that are actively attempting to access their Alliance's Beacons during the Autonomous Period. Referees will pay very close attention to Robots that intentionally Pin, Trap, or Block an opposing Alliance Robot that is actively attempting to access their Alliance's Beacon during the Autonomous Period. Robots should stay clear of the soft foam tile containing the white gaffers tape on the opposing Alliance's side of the Playing Field during the Autonomous Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-11-2016, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: If, during autonomous, a robot mistakenly activates the wrong color on one of their alliance's beacons, do they still earn an extra particle, or would the other alliance?<br />
<br />
Example: Red alliance mistakenly activates one of their beacons to blue, and blue alliance doesn't score one of their own beacons.  Would the blue alliance receive the particle?  The rule specifies that &quot;the states of all the Claims determines how many bonus Particles are released (up to a maximum of two)&quot;)<br />
Answer: For the example, if the Beacon is illuminated blue at the end of the Autonomous Period, the Blue Alliance will receive one Blue Particle and thirty points for the Beacon triggered in their favor by the Red Alliance Robot.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Robots may avoid awarding a Particle and points to the opposing Alliance by recognizing that the Beacon was triggered in favor of the opposing Alliance and pressing the button again to change the Beacon color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-11-2016, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.5.2 Autonomous period summary: &quot;...the bonus Particles, if any, will be introduced onto the field by the Referees by placing them into the corresponding Alliance&#8217;s Corner Vortex for the Alliance that earned them so that they roll down one of the Particle Returns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: Is it to be assumed that it will be the decision of the referee as to which of the Particle Returns the new Particles are introduced? And once decided, would it be the same for both alliances?<br />
<br />
The concern is that perhaps one Particle Run introduces the Bonus Particles in a way more beneficial to one Alliance if the introduction is not standard.<br />
Answer:  A referee will place the Particle in the Corner Vortex where the left and right side Particle Return ramps meet at the Vortex Bar. The Particle should have an equal likelihood of rolling down the left or right ramp. The intent is that the Particle will be introduced to a random location on the Playing Field Floor, subject to the design of the Corner Vortex Particle Return ramps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-17-2016, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post #5, Answer #2 in the autonomous period answer thread states that it is legal to &quot;'sweep' the area to push other robots away from their beacons,&quot; provided that &quot;the opposing Alliance Robot does not become Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked&quot;.<br />
<br />
Post #8 in the autonomous period answer thread states that &quot;Robots should stay clear of the soft foam tile containing the white gaffers tape on the opposing Alliance's side of the Playing Field during the Autonomous Period.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the Game Manual, Blocking is defined as &quot;Preventing an opposing Alliance Robot from accessing an Area or Alliance specific Game Element for an extended period of time by obstructing ALL paths of travel to the object or Area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: Is it legal for a robot to &quot;sweep&quot; (drive over but not park on) the opposing Alliance's side of the Playing Field (including the area by the beacons) during autonomous after the 10 seconds have passed?<br />
Answer: It is legal for a Robot to drive around Inside the opposing Alliance's Area of the Playing Field after the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period have elapsed. Keep in mind that all of the rules apply to the Autonomous Period unless the Game Manual or Q&amp;A Forum grants an exception. For example, rule &lt;G16&gt; is violated if the defending Robot is Inside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape at the same time that an opposing Alliance Robot is approaching their Alliance's Beacon. In this scenario, the defending Robot is Blocking because it is between the opposing Alliance Robot and their Alliance's Beacon. A rule &lt;G16&gt; violation can occur if the defending Robot is Parked or moving. &quot;Staying clear of the soft foam tile containing the white gaffers tape&quot; is a guideline that will help to keep a Robot from receiving a Penalty for Blocking access to the opposing Alliance's Beacon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-31-2016, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: When parking a robot on the Corner Vortex during the autonomous period, to preclude sliding back down the ramp, is it legal to have one of your robot's wheels parked in the Vortex Bar area where the level changes from the Corner Vortex Ramp to the Particle Return ramp? There would be no part of the robot grasping, only the wheel sitting in the lower level of where balls are scored.  Thanks for all you do.<br />
Answer: The Robot in the scenario is violating the Corner Vortex Scoring rule &lt;GS3&gt;, because it is breaking the vertical plane of the outside (facing the Playing Field Wall) vertical face of the Vortex Bar and it is probably making contact with the Particle Return ramp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-02-2016, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: Ten seconds or later in the autonomous period a red alliance robot goes over to the blue alliance side of the playing field and intentionally parks on the blue alliance corner vortex.<br />
<br />
Question 1:  Is doing this legal as long as it is after 10 seconds?<br />
<br />
Question 2:  Will the red alliance robot earn points for parking on the corner vortex?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
Answer 1: This is a legal strategy, provided that a Blue Alliance Robot doesn't attempt to access the Corner Vortex while it is Blocked by the Red Alliance Robot.<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;G16&gt; Penalties will come into play if a Blue Alliance Robot attempts to access the Corner Vortex while access is Blocked by the Red Alliance Robot that is intentionally Parked or Completely Parked On the Corner Vortex.<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;G16&gt; Penalties will not come into play if, in the opinion of the referees, the intent of the Red Alliance Robot was not to Park on the opposing Alliance's Corner Vortex. For example, rule &lt;G16&gt; Penalties will not come into play if Parking on the Corner Vortex was caused by the Red Alliance Robot colliding with another Robot.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, even if rule &lt;G16&gt; Penalties come into play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-21-2016, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: May a robot trigger both of their alliance's beacons during the autonomous period?  <br />
<br />
Question 2: May a robot push the opposing alliance's beacons after the ten seconds is up?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Answer 1: Yes.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: No, per rule &lt;GS6&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-15-2016, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 1.5.2 #4 states that &quot;Robots Parked Completely On the Center Vortex Base Area earn ten (10) points&quot;. Since the Center Vortex Base Area is 2 ft. x 2 ft (with a pole on center point), what is the definition of &quot;parking completely&quot; (for the case when a robot is 18 in x 18 in)? From my understanding, parking completely on center vortex base area is impossible for this robot dimension.<br />
Answer: The term &quot;Completely On&quot; is defined in Section 1.4 of the Game Manual Part 2 in the &quot;On/Completely On&quot; section. The definition of Completely On applies to all Robot sizes.<br />
<br />
Challenge from the Game Design Committee: Professor Proton envisions three ways that a Robot with an 18 inch x 18 inch drivetrain footprint can Park Completely On the Center Vortex Base. Will a Robot with a maximum footprint dimension accomplish this achievement in an official Match?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-01-2017, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a few questions regarding Posts #8 and #11 in the Game Rules, Autonomous Period answer thread. The following questions pertain to the Autonomous Period.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Can a robot pass through the opposing alliance's tiles with white tape during the last 20 seconds of the autonomous period if no opposing alliance robots are on the tiles and if no contact with opposing alliance robots occurs?<br />
<br />
Question 2: The Answer to post #11 says in part &quot;Rule &lt;G16&gt; is violated if the defending Robot is Inside the Area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape at the same time that an opposing Alliance Robot is approaching their Alliance's Beacon.&quot;  Rule G16 says &quot;A Robot cannot cause an opposing Alliance Robot to become Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked for more than five seconds.&quot;  May a robot contact an opposing alliance's robot that is on one of its tiles with white tape in front of a beacon if it does it defensively without blocking access to a beacon and if it does it for less than 5 seconds?<br />
<br />
Question 3: Can a robot park on the opposing alliance's tile against the wall between the two beacons with no white tape during the last 20 seconds of the autonomous period?<br />
<br />
Question 4: If the answer to Q3 is yes, will any penalties be assessed if the parked robot is then pushed onto a tile with white tape by one of the opposing alliance's robots? Would G17 would protect the robot in this scenario?<br />
Answer 1: Yes, if an opposing Alliance Robot is not attempting to access the Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, if no rules are violated. If a referee believes that the Robot's actions are part of a deliberate strategy, (s)he will watch carefully for a rule &lt;G16&gt; infraction.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: In general, this action is allowed. The actions and locations of the other Robots may play a role in the legality of the scenario. For example, rule &lt;G16&gt; and the related guidance provided by the Game Design Committee in the game Q&amp;A forum could come into play.<br />
<br />
Answer 4: Rule &lt;G17&gt; would protect the defensive Robot in this scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-02-2017, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: After the first 10 second in autonomous, a blue Alliance robot crosses onto the red side of the field and parks directly in between the two red alliance beacons, on the tile without any gaffers tape. <br />
<br />
While this transpires, a red alliance robot moves toward the red alliance beacons closest to the corner vortex and claims it for their alliance. The red alliance robot then proceeds to move parallel with the field perimeter wall towards the second red alliance beacons and along the way it encounters the blue alliance robot mentioned above.<br />
<br />
The red alliance robot is then able to push the blue alliance robot along the wall and onto the tile located directly in front of the second beacon (the one with the gaffers tape); however, the red robot was not able to push the blue robot far enough to gain access to their beacon.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Would this be considered blocking access by the blue alliance robot?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If the answer to question 1 is &quot;yes&quot;, at what point would it be considered blocking access, at initial contact between robots or when the blue robot comes into contact with the tile in front of the beacon? <br />
<br />
Question 3: Same scenario as above occurs, but the red alliance robot is able to push the blue robot completely across the tile in front of the beacon and still claim the beacon for the red alliance. Would this be considered blocking access?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer 1: No, the Blue Alliance Robot is protected by rule &lt;G17&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Not applicable.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: No, the Blue Alliance Robot is protected by rule &lt;G17&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-09-2017, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;GS7&gt; specifies: Autonomous Period Robot Keep Out Area – Robots may not go Inside the opposing Alliance’s Area of the Playing Field during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period.<br />
<br />
Question: May a robot intentionally knock its alliance's cap ball into the opposing alliance's side of the field in the first ten seconds of the autonomous period?<br />
Answer: Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-13-2017, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: During the autonomous period of several matches, a red alliance robot triggers both of their alliance's beacons to the correct color, before driving over to the opposing alliance's side of the field and parking in front of their beacon, inside the protected area. The protected area is the area defined by the soft foam floor tile (not including the tile connecting teeth) that contains the one-inch-wide strip of white gaffers tape.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Does this violate any rules?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Same as the scenario, except the blue alliance robot is in the protected area around the beacon before the red robot arrives. The red alliance robot pushes the blue alliance robot sideways away from the beacon and parks in front of the opposing alliance's beacon. Is this allowed?<br />
<br />
Question 3: Same as the scenario, except the blue alliance robot is in the protected area around the beacon before the red robot arrives. The red alliance robot pins the blue alliance robot against the playing field perimeter wall, preventing the blue alliance robot from triggering their beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 1: The Red Alliance Robot's actions are allowed if a Blue Alliance Robot does not attempt to access the Blue Alliance Beacon that is Blocked by the Red Alliance Robot. Rule &lt;G16&gt; consequences come into play if the Blue Alliance Robot attempts to access the Blocked Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes, the action is allowed if the Blue Alliance Robot is not attempting to drive back to access the Beacon while the Red Alliance Robot is inside the protected Area in front the Beacon. Rule &lt;G16&gt; is violated if the Blue Alliance Robot attempts to maneuver back to the Beacon and it is Blocked by a Red Alliance Robot that is In the protected Area in front of the Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: The Red Alliance Robot's actions violate rule &lt;G16&gt; for Pinning if the referee determines that it is a deliberate strategy. The Red Alliance Robot having performed this maneuver during several preceding Matches will influence the referee's determination of the Robot's intended strategy for the current Match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-24-2017, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to get some clarification on what constitutes blocking of a beacon for a defensive autonomous routine.  Please note all of these scenarios take place after the 10 second mark.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If a red alliance robot on the red alliance side has fully entered the tile with the white line when a blue alliance robot enters the tile with the white line makes contact and pushes and prevents the red alliance from claiming the correct beacon color, is this considered blocking?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If the incorrect button in question 1 was pressed due to robot contact, provided nothing else occurs with the beacon, is the beacon claimed for the blue alliance?<br />
<br />
Question 3: If a red alliance robot on the red alliance side has not yet entered the tile with the white line when a blue alliance robot that is partially in the tile with the white line makes contact and pushes and prevents the red alliance robot from entering the tile with the white line, is this considered blocking?<br />
<br />
Question 4: If a red alliance robot on the red alliance side has partially entered the tile with the white line when a blue alliance robot is moving through the tile with the white line makes contact and pushes and prevents the red alliance robot from fully entering the tile with the white line, is this considered blocking?<br />
A Robot cannot incur a &lt;G16&gt; Penalty during the Autonomous Period unless it is determined by a referee to be part of a deliberate strategy. The defensive Robot's behavior in previous Matches will influence the referee's determination of the Robot's intended strategy for the current Match. It is stated in the post that the Blue Alliance Robot is executing a &quot;defensive autonomous routine.&quot; Therefore, the following answers are based on the referee determining that the Blue Alliance Robot is intentionally playing defense.<br />
<br />
Answer 1: No.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: During the Autonomous Period, the answer depends on which Robot triggered the Beacon. A Red Alliance Beacon triggered by contact with a Red Alliance Robot is counted as Scored based on the illuminated color of the Beacon. A Red Alliance Beacon triggered by contact with a Blue Alliance Robot violates rule &lt;GS6&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: Yes.<br />
<br />
Answer 4: A Blue Alliance Robot entering the restricted Area around the Beacon before the Red Alliance Robot attempts to enter the restricted Area is Blocking if the Red Alliance Robot attempts to access the Beacon. A Blue Alliance Robot entering the restricted Area around the Beacon after the Red Alliance Robot enters the restricted Area is not Blocking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-25-2017, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: During Autonomous, the robot was stopped prior to the end of the 30 seconds.  Does the team receive a penalty or is the robot disabled for the driver controlled period?<br />
Answer: The Robot may participate in the Driver-Controlled Period and multiple Penalties could come into play. Rule &lt;G26&gt; for egregious behavior is violated if the Drive Team stops their Robot during the Autonomous Period for strategic reasons. A rule &lt;G26&gt; violation will result in a Yellow Card and Major Penalty for the offending Team. Subsequent violations of rule &lt;G26&gt; will result in Team Disqualification from the tournament.<br />
 <br />
Section 1.5.2 in the Game Manual Part 2 states that &quot;Teams are not allowed to control Robot behavior with the Driver Station or any other actions during the Autonomous Period.&quot; Rule &lt;GS4&gt; is violated if the Team uses the Driver Station or any other actions to stop their Robot from playing the game during the Autonomous Period. If rule &lt;GS4&gt; is violated, a Minor Penalty will be assessed and the affected Robot is not eligible to Claim a Beacon in the Autonomous Period.<br />
<br />
Drive Teams may stop their Robot for safety reasons without Penalty. When possible, consult with a Field Technical Advisor or Referee before stopping a Robot for safety reasons during the Autonomous Period.<br />
<br />
No Penalty is assessed when the robot controller software without intervention by the Team, stops the Robot from playing the game early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-31-2017, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A red alliance robot is pressing the beacon button during its autonomous run. During the first 10 seconds of the autonomous period, a blue alliance robot intentionally crosses into the red alliance's side of the playing field and interferes with the red alliance robot. The red alliance robot is not able to continue its autonomous routine to claim the second beacon and move the cap ball off the center vortex base as it has successfully done in previous matches. Are any rules violated by the blue alliance robot?<br />
Answer: Yes, rule &lt;GS7&gt; is violated because the Blue Alliance Robot entered the opposing Alliance's Area of the Playing Field during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period. A Major Penalty should be assessed because the action by the Blue Alliance Robot is not Inadvertent and Inconsequential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">02-08-2017, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: If a robot scores a particle in the center vortex during the autonomous period but the particle falls back onto the robot and does not touch the floor, does the robot still score the 15 points since the particle traveled through the vortex?<br />
Answer: Yes, the Particle counts as Scored if it was released into the goal and rolled through the Vortex. The Particle &quot;falling back onto the Robot&quot; after Scoring does not cancel out the points awarded for the legally Scored Particle. The Particle is not eligible to be Scored again until it contacts the Playing Field Floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">02-13-2017, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: After the first 10 seconds of the Autonomous period, may RobotA repeatedly enter an opponent's tile with the white tape in front of a beacon, remain there for under 5 seconds, then leave the tile entirely for a second, and repeat the process over and over for the remainder of the Autonomous period, for the purpose of pushing or otherwise hindering opposing robots trying to push their beacon buttons, if there is no period of time when RobotA occupies the tile with the white tape for more than 5 consecutive seconds (as G16 says is necessary for Blocking penalties to apply)?<br />
Answer: In this scenario, the Autonomous Period exception for enforcing rule &lt;G16&gt; does not apply because the Robot is using a deliberate strategy. The defensive Robot must move away at least three feet from the restricted Area around the Beacon after each Blocking event. Since the Team is intentionally violating or &quot;gaming&quot; a rule, they are likely to be warned by the referees about egregious behavior and the consequences or rule &lt;G26&gt;. In this scenario, the Team should expect the referees to rapidly escalate to applying &lt;G26&gt; consequences to the Team.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-22-2016, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 5.3.1 of the Game Manual Part 1 asks teams to reflect on their Robot's design and the question: “If everybody did this, would the game play be impossible? If the answer to the question is yes, the design component is probably not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
VELOCITY VORTEX is played with Particles that are Scored in goals and recycled back to the Playing Field for continuous game play. The Game Design Committee's intent is for open recycling, where Scored Particles return to random locations on the Playing Field Floor so that both Robots on an Alliance have an equal opportunity to access, Control, or Possess their Alliance's Scored Particles. A closed recycling game strategy that denies a reasonable opportunity for an Alliance Partner Robot to access, Control, or Possess a Scored Particle is not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge and is not allowed. Game play with closed recycling of Particles would be impossible and unfair to Alliance Partners. Therefore, Robot designs and/or game strategies that deny their Alliance Partner equal access to Scored Particles, is considered to be a violation of rule &lt;GS2&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-28-2016, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal to intentionally lift the cap ball during the Driver-Controlled Period for transportation purposes? In Game Manual 2, rule &lt;GS15&gt; states that &quot;Robots may not Intentionally perform any End Game scoring achievements prior to the start of the End Game,&quot; but also states &quot;Intentional Controlled movement of an Alliance’s own Cap Ball is allowed at all times.&quot; So assuming we're not setting up for scoring, would we be allowed to lift the ball above the floor just enough to have complete control over it for transportation around the field?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer: Intentionally lifting the Cap Ball any height above the Playing Field Floor is an act of Scoring an achievement that is reserved for the End Game. Intentionally lifting the Cap Ball before the start of the End Game violates rule &lt;GS15&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had our first qualifying tournament last weekend, and something came up that we hadn't thought about.<br />
<br />
The particles and cap balls tend to frequently end up in the non-ramp corners of the playing field during the TeleOp period. This is especially true of the particles introduced by rolling them down the particle returns after the autonomous period. Those simply roll into that corner unless there a robot parked in the way.<br />
<br />
Question: If, for instance, two blue particles are in the corner of the field behind/under a red cap ball that is also in the same corner, is the blue alliance allowed to bump the red cap ball out of the way so they can retrieve the blue scoring elements? Or are those elements considered out-of-play for the blue alliance until the red alliance comes and removes the red cap ball?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: Yes, the Blue Alliance Robot may briefly Control the red Cap Ball for the purpose of gaining access to the Blocked blue Particles.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Drive Teams should not take advantage of this exception to gain an intentional tactical advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-06-2016, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a follow-up to question #3 in the Driver Controlled Period thread.<br />
<br />
Based on on the sentence in GS15 that states:<br />
<br />
   Intentional Controlled movement of an Alliance’s own Cap Ball is allowed at all times.<br />
<br />
And the answer to post #3 that is focused on whether the Cap Ball is lifted, it is our understanding that we can move the cap ball to our preferred location for end-game scoring before the end game as long as we don't lift the ball off the mat.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Is this correct? <br />
<br />
Question 2: If so, can we also actually grasp the Cap Ball and move it before end game (again as long as we don't lift it off the mat) to move it to a strategic location?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Answer 1: Yes.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-15-2016, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: Since beacons are equal-opportunity scoring elements in the Driver-Controlled period, is a robot permitted to BLOCK a beacon that it currently &quot;Claims&quot;, to prevent the opposing alliance from changing its color?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Does this ruling depend on the Defending robot's color or the side of the field that the beacon is currently on?  <br />
<br />
Comment:  It's exciting that offense &amp; defense switch colors at the same time the beacon does.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Answer 1: No, rule &lt;G16&gt; comes into play during the Driver-Controlled Period if an opposing Alliance Robot attempts to access the Blocked Beacon.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-16-2016, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: If two opposing alliance robots are approaching the same unclaimed beacon, with robot #1 pushing robot #2 away to reach it and closing off all access to it in the process, is this considered blocking?<br />
Answer: Robot #1 is not Blocking Robot #2, provided that Robot #1 moves away from the Beacon in a timely manner so that Robot #2 may access the Beacon. Referees will allow a reasonable amount of time for Robot #1 to interact with the Beacon and move away before issuing a Blocking Penalty warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-16-2016, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: During the driver-controlled period, if a red robot is sitting in front of a beacon so that it is blocking only one button, is this still considered blocking access, since a blue robot could simply press the open button to claim it for their alliance?<br />
Answer: The scenario described is not Blocking access. For Blocking access to apply, ALL paths to the Beacon would need to be Blocked. The scenario suggests that a path to a button on the Beacon is available for the Blue Alliance Robot. That the path available is not a preferred or easiest path is not sufficient to deem all paths Blocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-21-2016, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A blue alliance cap ball is in a corner of the playing field. A red alliance robot continuously oscillates back and forth within approximately a foot in front of the cap ball in the corner to prevent the opposing alliance from gaining possession during the end game.<br />
<br />
Question: Since moving back and forth when the opposing alliance tries to move around the alliance robot would not be blocking all access to the cap ball at one time, would this action be considered legal or be considered blocking?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Answer: The scenario described in the question is Blocking access to an Alliance specific Game Element and it is not allowed per rule &lt;G16&gt;. The Red Alliance Robot is actively defending a constrained area of the Playing Field; intentionally Blocking access to an area that contains an Alliance specific Scoring Element. The active defense played by the Red Alliance Robot eliminates all paths of travel between the Blue Alliance Robot and the blue Cap Ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">11-21-2016, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: Before the end game during the driver-controlled period a robot's controlled pushing of a cap ball causes the ball to bounce and lose contact with the playing field floor. The robot is not attempting to lift the cap ball.<br />
<br />
Question: Does the cap ball losing contact with the floor (i.e. bouncing) because of controlled pushing by a robot violate rule &lt;GS15&gt;?<br />
Answer: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-06-2016, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We understand that we are allowed to grasp a Cap Ball before the End Game, as long as we are not lifting it.<br />
<br />
We also understand that unintentional Cap Ball bouncing during controlled movement (pushing or pulling) will not be penalized.<br />
<br />
Question #1: If we maximize the controlled movement of the Cap Ball prior to End Game, by grasping around it (not under it), as a defensive measure, to prevent other teams from knocking it out, as opposed to loosely controlling it with extending assemblies, and we are clearly not engaging the lift mechanism to lift the Cap Ball, should we be penalized for intentionally starting the End Game early due to the Cap Ball bouncing during controlled movement?<br />
<br />
Question #2: If during controlled movement, the Cap Ball lifts off of the mat, due to inadvertently running over a particle should we be penalized for intentionally starting the End Game early?<br />
<br />
Answer #1: This question was previously addressed in the &quot;Driver Controlled Period - Answer Thread&quot; post #5.<br />
<br />
Answer #2: A referee watching the Match will determine if the Robot is intentionally or Inadvertently lifting the Cap Ball. Intentionally lifting the Cap Ball before the start of the End Game violates rule &lt;GS15&gt;. An Inadvertently raised Cap Ball above the Playing Field Floor does not violate rule &lt;GS15&gt;. A Cap Ball running over a Particle is likely to be viewed as Inadvertent and not Penalized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-07-2016, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal to move the other alliance's cap ball during the driver controlled period and before the end game if it appears that it is blocking access to (1) Your alliance's cap ball, or (2) access to the center vortex.  We ended up having a cap ball getting caught between our robot and the center pole when trying to cap, and wished we would have moved it prior to lifting the ball.  I have a feeling 1 is legal for momentary control but 2 is not.  I'd just like to make sure I'm not misinterpreting the rules.  Thanks for your help.<br />
Answer: A Robot may briefly Control the opposing Alliance's Cap Ball if the Cap Ball is Blocking Access to the Alliance's own Scoring Element(s) or Vortex goal. <br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: The intent of this ruling is to allow Robots to nudge the opposing Alliance's Cap Ball out of the way to gain access to their Alliance's Scoring Element(s) or Vortex goal. Drive Teams should not take advantage of this exception to gain an intentional tactical advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-20-2016, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A red alliance robot backs up to shoot particles at the beginning of the end game and in the process, pins the blue cap ball between it and the side of the field. The blue cap ball is pinned so tightly that the blue alliance robot cannot retrieve it.<br />
<br />
Question: Does this violate any rules?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer: The Red Alliance Robot is violating rule &lt;GS10&gt; because it is Controlling the opposing Alliance's Cap Ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-20-2016, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: When does the match end? When the buzzer first sounds or when the buzzer stops?<br />
Match example: a blue alliance robot is attempting to change a beacon color, the buzzer sounds and while the buzzer is sounding a beacon is pushed, the beacon flashes and changes from red to blue after the buzzer sounds and/or stops, is the beacon scored as red or blue?<br />
Answer: Stopping game play late is addressed in rule &lt;G8&gt;. As stated in the rule, the intent is for Robots to stop playing the game within a reasonable human reaction time following the start of the game sound (i.e. buzzer) signaling the end of the Match. Drive Teams should make their best effort to stop game play immediately when the end of the Match game sound begins. Before the Penalties come into play, referees will use their discretion to give Drive Teams an approximate one second grace period following the conclusion of the game sound signaling the end of the Match for Robots to stop playing the game.<br />
<br />
Match Example: The Beacon should be Scored as blue because the button was pressed while the buzzer was sounding. A button press that occurs before the conclusion of the one second grace period following the end of the Match should count as Scored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-18-2017, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Driver Controlled period - Answer Thread post #8 indicated that blocking one button on a beacon would be permissible as long as the other was accessible.  We would like to request clarification of this as it is of value as a defense strategy. For simplicity, assume to max size (18x18x18) cubic robots, and the &quot;defending&quot; robot has already switched colors to its own.<br />
<br />
Question 1: During the driver controlled period, can the defending robot shield/cover/block the beacon all the way to the horizontal midpoint of the beacon or just across from the edge to the button it is defending?<br />
Question 2: Does it matter if the opponent's robot has no mechanism available to press the beacon from a corner (e.g. it's &quot;button pusher&quot; is located at the midpoint of its &quot;front&quot;)? In this case the opponent would have no ability to push the button without forcibly pushing the defending robot out of the way (and if so, would this incur a penalty?).<br />
Question 3: If the defending robot was situated between a pair of beacons and along the wall, would it be permitted to shift back and forth along the wall, blocking the nearest button on each side, while the opponent robot attempted to go the long way around (the only non-collision path open to it)?<br />
Answer 1: The defending Robot may Block all the way to the horizontal midpoint of the Beacon without incurring rule &lt;G16&gt; consequences.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The design of the opposing Alliance's Robot is inconsequential. Pushing a Robot is allowed if rule &lt;G16&gt; is not violated.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: The scenario described in the question is not Blocking access because the defensive Robot is only Blocking access to one button on the Beacon. See Answer #1 for more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">02-06-2017, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: If a robot on the red alliance sits in front of a beacon during the driver-controlled period, blocking both of the buttons on it, that has been changed to the color blue, could the robot potentially sit in front of this beacon the entire match and then at the last second change it to red? Would this incur a penalty if a blue alliance robot tried to access this beacon since it is already changed to blue and a blue alliance robot trying to access it would have no offensive play to the blue alliance since it is already their color?<br />
Answer: The Red Alliance Robot is violating rule &lt;G16&gt; if a Blue Alliance Robot attempts to access the Beacon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the End Game, a Robot can lift the Cap Ball off of the Playing Field Floor for points. According to the definition of the Playing Field Floor, &quot;The surface of the tiles that make up the base of the playing field,&quot; rolling the ball onto the corner vortex would count as being lifted to the low height.<br />
<br />
Question: Does placing the Cap Ball or leaving the Cap Ball on the base of the Center Vortex count as low height as well since the base of the Center Vortex is not a tile?<br />
Answer: Great question! A Cap Ball On the Center Vortex Base does not earn Cap Ball Low Height points.<br />
<br />
Confirmation: A Cap Ball that is On the Corner Vortex and is not in contact with the Playing Field Floor qualifies for the End Game Low Height Scoring achievement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;GS11&gt; states: &quot;The intent of this rule is to allow Robots to Score the Cap Ball without interference. A Robot interaction with an opposing Alliance Robot may be ruled at the referee&#8217;s discretion to be Inconsequential and Inadvertent and will not be Penalized.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question: Is this to be interpreted as only protecting robots in possession of the cap ball WHILST in the act of scoring? In other words, when a cap ball is knocked out of possession by a direct act of an opposing robot, are no penalties assessed if the affected robot was not actually in the act of scoring?<br />
Answer: During the End Game, a Robot Possessing a Cap Ball that is raised any height above the Playing Field Floor is in the process of Scoring the elevated Cap Ball achievement and is protected by rule &lt;GS11&gt;.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Robots using an elevated Cap Ball during the End Game to gain an advantage over their opponent, other than the Score value of the Cap Ball, is not allowed. Examples of inappropriate use of &lt;GS11&gt; protections are:<br />
<br />
Using a Cap Ball to intentionally:<br />
i) Block an opposing Alliance Robot (&lt;G16&gt;).<br />
ii) Block an opposing Alliance Robot that is attempting to access their Alliance's Corner Vortex&#8203; (&lt;GS14&gt;).<br />
ii) Block an opposing Alliance Robot that is attempting to access their Alliance's Cap Ball or Particles (&lt;GS10&gt;).<br />
iv) Interfere with an opposing Alliance's Particles that have been launched/released with the intention of Scoring (&lt;GS9&gt;).<br />
<br />
Penalties should not be assessed against an opposing Alliance Robot when an inappropriate use of a rule &lt;GS11&gt; protection has been used against them (&lt;G17&gt;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answer #3 in the Miscellaneous Game Questions thread says &quot;Yes, Robots may purposefully Control the rotation of the Center Vortex, provided that no other rules are violated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;GS11&gt; says in part &quot;During the End Game, Robots may not interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot that Possesses a lifted Cap Ball above the Playing Field Floor&quot; and &quot;The intent of this rule is to allow Robots to Score the Cap Ball without interference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 1: May a robot rotate the Center Vortex during the End Game to move it away from an opposing alliance's robot that is trying to score their Cap Ball on the Center Vortex, or to make it difficult for that robot to score the Cap Ball?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If a robot rotates the Center Vortex and causes the Center Vortex to hit the Cap Ball held by an opposing alliance's robot, is that action subject to &lt;GS11&gt; Cap Ball Interference penalties (even if the robot makes no contact with the Cap Ball or the opposing robot) or is that a legal defensive strategy?<br />
Answer 1: The action described violates rule &lt;GS11&gt; because it interferes with a Robot that is attempting to Score a Cap Ball.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The action described violates rule &lt;GS11&gt; because it interferes with a Robot that is attempting to Score a Cap Ball.</div></div><hr />

The opposing alliance robot is not lifting the cap ball in this scenario but trying to lift up an arm to dump the particles into the center vortex.<br />

Answer: A Robot attempting to Score a Cap Ball in the Center Vortex is playing offense, therefore, the action described does not violate rule &lt;GS11&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-11-2016, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In light of End Game #5 answer: &quot;Answer 1: The action described violates rule &lt;GS11&gt; because it interferes with a Robot that is attempting to Score a Cap Ball.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm concerned about whether teams attempting to cap the center vortex will be penalized by movement of the vortex (by their own robot).<br />
<br />
It's hard to conceive of a method of capping the Center Vortex, that is guaranteed NOT to move it.<br />
<br />
Question 1: So, if two teams are both attempting to cap the Vortex, and the vortex is rotated in the process, how/will penalties be assessed?<br />
<br />
To me, this brings up the eternal question of: Intent or Accident?  &quot;Was the vortex movement intentional or accidental &quot; (regardless of the consequence to the opponent). This can be impossible for the refs to know.<br />
<br />
Question 2: So...   are teams generally excluded from getting a &lt;GS11&gt; penalty if they are also in possession of a Cap Ball in end game, because that automatically puts them in potential capping mode? Or will refs be put in the position of having to decide intent?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Answer 1: Robots attempting to Score a Cap Ball in the Center Vortex are playing offense and are not subject to rule &lt;GS11&gt; constraints/Penalties.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The referee will make the determination if a Robot is attempting to Score their Alliance's Cap Ball (i.e. playing offense) or interfering with an opposing Alliance Robot that is attempting to Score a Cap Ball (i.e. playing defense). In general, Robots playing offense will not receive a &lt;GS11&gt; Penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">10-31-2016, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A robot scores the cap ball in the center vortex using a lifting mechanism that has a string on the end of two forklift-like prongs. The string may get stuck behind the vertical red or blue tubing, leaving that robot unable to raise said forklift and exit that area without lifting out the cap ball as well. <br />
<br />
Question 1: Is it legal to end the game in that position with the string around the center vortex?<br />
Question 2: Would that ruling be differnet even if it were not in contact with anything?<br />
Answer 1: The scenario violates rule &lt;G15&gt; due to Robot entanglement with the Center Vortex and rule &lt;G14&gt; for grasping a Game Element.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The scenario violates rule &lt;G15&gt; due to Robot entanglement with a Game Element.</div></div><hr />

Answer: The Red Alliance Robot is violating rule &lt;GS14&gt; because it is Blocking the Blue Alliance Robot from Scoring a Particle in the blue Corner Vortex. In this scenario, the Blue Alliance Robot should not be called for violating the Cap Ball interference rule, &lt;GS11&gt;.<br />
<br />
If the Blue Alliance Robot makes contact with the Red Alliance Robot without an attempt to Score a Particle, rule &lt;GS11&gt; would also apply and the Blue Alliance Robot could be guilty of Cap Ball interference if the contact is not both Inconsequential and Inadvertent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question: When scoring the cap ball, if one of the L brackets on the end happens to get caught on one of the poles of our center vortex by accident and we end up incidentally turning the center vortex would this be considered grasping?<br />
Answer: Referees watching the Match will determine if the Robot grasps the Center Vortex and violates rule &lt;G14&gt;. Depending on the actions of the Robot, the &quot;L bracket&quot; could grasp the Center Vortex or it could legally interact with the Center Vortex.</div></div><hr />

Question: Would that count as a capped score, or high score?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer: The Center Vortex is Scored as Capped because the Robot is not touching the Cap Ball. <br />
<br />
There is insufficient detail in the description of the scenario to discern if there are any rule violations. It is possible that the Robot is violating rules &lt;G14&gt; for grasping the Center Vortex and &lt;G15&gt; if the Robot is entangled in the Center Vortex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-08-2016, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team is using a lift with a piece of duct tape on the end of an arm to lift our cap ball.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If for some reason, we score the cap ball but that piece of duct tape comes off inadvertently, and remains attached to the ball, would that violate rule &lt;G13&gt;, or any other rule giving a penalty? If not, would &lt;G19&gt; still apply, counting the cap ball as un-scored?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If the cap ball is within the vortex, but the duct tape is still attached and just after the match ends, the tape falls from the ball. Would this count as scored?<br />
<br />
Thanks! <br />
Answer 1: Rule &lt;GS16&gt; is in play because the Cap Ball in the scenario is in contact with the Robot. The Center Vortex is not Scored as Capped because of Robot contact with the Cap Ball. The Cap Ball is eligible to receive Scoring points based on its height.<br />
<br />
The first instance of the tape detaching from the Robot will result in a warning for violating rule &lt;G13&gt;. Repeated tape detaching from the Robot in a subsequent Match will be considered as deliberate. After the warning, instances of detached tape should receive a Minor Penalty because the action is no longer Inadvertent. A Major Penalty could be assessed for affecting the game play of the Cap Ball if the tape remains attached to a Cap Ball that is not In the Center Vortex goal nor Controlled by the offending Robot (i.e., the Cap Ball is accessible to other Robots).<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;S1&gt; consequences will be applied for damaging a Game Element if the tape leaves a residue on the Cap Ball that affects game play.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: The Center Vortex would be counted as Capped. Rules &lt;G13&gt; and &lt;S1&gt; consequences will be applied as described in Answer #1 above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-14-2016, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: If we claim a beacon and are sitting in front of it, blocking both buttons, but the other alliance isn't trying to access it to score then does that count as blocking access?<br />
<br />
Question 2: We have to push our cap ball up against a wall to get it onto our forks to score. Once it is on we don't drive much for fear that it will fall off and we just lift it in the air from where we are. If this occurs against a beacon, are we considered blocking the beacon even though we are performing the action of lifting the cap ball. Can we only lift the cap ball in areas that aren't in front of the beacon?<br />
<br />
Question 3: In the case above, if we are raising the cap ball and a team is trying to access the beacon but bumps into us and knocks the cap ball off then do they incur a penalty?<br />
Answer 1: No. This question was previously addressed in the &quot;Driver Controlled Period - Answer Thread&quot; post #6.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: A Robot that has raised a Cap Ball off the Playing Field Floor is not protected from incurring Penalties for violating rule &lt;G16&gt;.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: A Robot may not use &lt;GS11&gt; protections to Block an opposing Alliance's access to a Beacon. The Robot lifting the Cap Ball is violating rule &lt;G16&gt; and it has an obligation to move out of the way. The Robot trying to access the Blocked Beacon should not receive a &lt;GS11&gt; Penalty.</div></div><hr />

Or, are End Game achievements defined as only the 10/20/40 points awarded for the position of the cap ball?<br />
<br />
Question 2: In the above scenario, could the team have returned the cap ball to the playing field, and then re-engaged it during end game and gone on to score the cap ball points?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: The rule &lt;GS15&gt; constraints and consequences only apply to the End Game achievements that are described in section 1.5.4 of the Game Manual Part 2. The End Game achievements are raising the Cap Balls Completely Off the Playing Field Floor and placing the Cap Balls into the Center Vortex.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 3 questions about interfering with the lifting of a cap ball: <br />
<br />
Question 1: If we are in an attempt to raise our cap ball or collect our cap ball and a robot from the other alliance gets stuck between our robot and our alliance partner's robot would they incur a penalty for blocking us/interfering with the cap ball lift since they are running into us as they are trying to get out of our way? Their intent is to get out of our way but because they are stuck between us and our alliance partner they have limited space to move which has caused the interference. <br />
<br />
Question 2: If we are in the process of lifting the cap ball and the other alliance is trying to push their cap ball up the ramp or clamp on to it but end up pushing it into our robot while we are lifting would that be considered interfering with our lift?<br />
<br />
Question 3: In the same scenario as question 2, would it change the penalty if they were still actively pushing the cap ball against us and not just letting the cap ball bounce off of us and move out of our way?<br />
<br />
Answer 1: For the case where the Robot is &quot;collecting the Cap Ball,&quot; there are no rule &lt;GS11&gt; consequences for Cap Ball interference because the rule &lt;GS11&gt; protections start when the Cap Ball is lifted off of the Playing Field Floor.<br />
<br />
For the scenario where the Robot has lifted the Cap Ball off of the Playing Field Floor, rules &lt;GS11&gt;, &lt;G16&gt;, and &lt;G17&gt; all come into play. First, we need to identify each robot: Red Alliance Robot 1 is lifting their Alliance's Cap Ball, Red Alliance Robot 2 is playing defense, and the Blue Alliance Robot is between the two Red Alliance Robots. Here is the call:<br />
<br />
a) The Red Alliance Robots are violating rule &lt;G16&gt; for Pinning the Blue Alliance Robot.<br />
b) The Blue Alliance Robot should not incur &lt;GS11&gt; consequences for attempting to drive away from the Red Alliance Robots because it is protected by rule &lt;G17&gt; while it is Pinned by the Red Alliance Robots.<br />
c) The Red Alliance Robots need to stop Pinning the Blue Alliance Robot. The Blue Alliance Robot should break contact with Red Alliance Robot 1 when the Pinning situation ends.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Rule &lt;GS11&gt; consequences should not come into play if both Robots are playing offense with a Cap Ball. Rule &lt;GS11&gt; consequences should come into play if one of the Robots is using a Cap Ball as part of a defensive strategy.<br />
<br />
Answer 3: A Robot may not use &lt;GS11&gt; protections to gain a defensive advantage over the opposing Alliance. The Robot that is intentionally pushing their Alliance's Cap Ball against an opposing Alliance Robot that is in the act of lifting their Alliance's Cap Ball is subject to rule &lt;GS11&gt; consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">During endgame, team A is up against a wall trying to pick up a particle. In the process, team A comes in to contact with the opposing alliance's cap ball which no team is currently trying to lift. While team A is still in contact with the cap ball, opposing team B initiates a lift of that cap ball. <br />
<br />
Question: Is team A obliged to remain still at that point? Any movement from team A would disturb team B's lift, but team B did not initiate their lift or contact with the cap ball until team A was already touching it.<br />
Answer: Since Team A initiated contact with the Cap Ball, their Robot is not protected from incurring rule &lt;GS11&gt; consequences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A red alliance robot parks on top of a blue alliance robot's cap ball lifting mechanism arm while a cap ball is possessed by the blue alliance robot. Because of this, once End Game started, the blue alliance robot was not able to lift the cap ball.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Should this be counted as cap ball interference even though our cap ball wasn't off the playing field floor but only because our ability to do that was prevented?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Does it matter if the opposing alliance's robot drives onto our arm before or after End Game begins?<br />
Answer 1: Rule &lt;GS11&gt; does not come into play because it protects a Robot that has lifted their Alliance's Cap Ball above the Playing Field Floor. The Red Alliance Robot is violating rule &lt;G16&gt; for Pinning the Blue Alliance Robot. If a referee determines that this rule is violated, the Red Alliance Robot will receive a Minor Penalty for every five seconds that they are in violation. If a referee declares a Pinning warning during the Driver-Controlled Period, the Red Alliance Robot must move away at least 0.9 m (3 feet) from the Pinned Blue Alliance Robot.<br />
<br />
Answer 2: No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-17-2017, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team is trying to lift the cap ball and is having some success. Now currently, we can push the cap ball against the wall and lift it off the floor; however, it still touches the wall.

<br />
Question 1: Is the wall considered part of the playing field floor?<br />
<br />
Question 2: If question 1 is a no, does lifting the cap ball off the floor, but having the ball still touch the wall count as &quot;Off Playing Field below crossbar?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-18-2017, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our fork-lift mechanism is such that after capping the ball, the fork-lift will be lowered and then pulled out of the cradle poles.  We are concerned that pulling out may cause the center vortex unit to rock/move.  We certainly do not want to cause our ball to tip, but also do not want to disrupt other team's cap ball to tip.<br />
<br />
Question: If our fork lift is not touching the cap ball, is it okay that the fork-lift mechanism is not fully outside of the center vortex goal?  <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
Answer: The Robot's fork-lift mechanism remaining Inside the Center Vortex goal after the Cap Ball is Scored may violate rule &lt;G15&gt; for Robot entanglement with a Game Element. To determine if there is a rule violation, the referee will assess the impact of the entanglement on the other Robots and the degree of entanglement with the Center Vortex goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">01-30-2017, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a question about how rule &lt;G8&gt; and its penalties apply specifically to scoring the cap ball at the end of the game.<br />
<br />
Suppose a robot has the cap ball sitting on top of their center vortex goal, but it is still touching it when the match ends. After the end of the match, the robot backs away so it is no longer touching the cap ball. <br />
<br />
Question: How is the cap ball scored? Would it be counted for 20 points for being above the cross bar but not capped, or none at all? And what penalties would be assessed for driving after the match ends? A major or a minor?<br />
Answer: The Robot backing away and stopping contact with the Cap Ball after the Match ends is a change in the Scoring state of the Cap Ball and is not allowed by rule &lt;G8&gt;. The Alliance will be awarded 20 points for a Cap Ball at the High height. A Minor Penalty will be assessed if the Robot's actions do not result in a competitive advantage (other than Scoring), otherwise, a Major Penalty will be assessed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">02-06-2017, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario: A red alliance robot is placing the cap ball on the center vortex goal. The red alliance robot can lower its arms, but cannot release the cap ball. So, to receive a score for capping, the robot must back up away from the center vortex. A blue alliance robot stops about 6-8 inches behind the red alliance robot so that it is unable to completely back away from the center vortex and remains in contact with the ball when time expires. <br />
<br />
Question: Is this a penalty on the blue alliance robot? At no time does the blue alliance robot come in contact with the red alliance robot.<br />
Answer: The Blue Alliance Robot is violating rule &lt;GS11&gt; for interfering with an opposing Alliance Robot that Possesses a lifted Cap Ball if the Blue Alliance Robot is not attempting to score its own Cap Ball in the Center Vortex goal. The Blue Alliance Robot is also violating rule &lt;G16&gt; for Trapping the Red Alliance Robot if the Trapped condition persists for more than five seconds.</div></div><hr />
