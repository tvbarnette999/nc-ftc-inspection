<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-24-2015, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider the situation where two Robots, one from each Alliance, Inadvertently cross In to the opposing Alliance Area during the first 10 seconds of the Autonomous Period and contact each other. For example, if both robots were straddling the Red/Blue line of gaffer's tape. If the Scoring of one Robot (say, Red) is unaffected by the contact but the Scoring of the other one (Blue) is affected by the contact, are there penalties?<br>
A: Referees observing the Match will use their judgment to determine if an Alliance gains an advantage by violating rule &lt;GS5&gt;. If, in the opinion of the Referees, an Alliance violates this rule and gains an advantage, a Major Penalty will be assessed against the offending Alliance. For example, if the early entry into the opposing Alliance's Area prevented scoring by an opposing Alliance Robot, this created an advantage for the offending Alliance and a Major Penalty should be assessed.<br>
<br>
Game Design Committee Recommendations: 1) Coordinate Robot travel paths with your Alliance Partner to avoid collisions that may result in early entry into the opposing Alliance Area. 2) Plan Robot travel paths so that they don't approach the opposing Alliance Area during the first 10 seconds of the Autonomous Period.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-24-2015, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider the situation where a Robot (e.g., Red) Inadvertently crosses into the opposing Alliance Area during the first 10 seconds of the Autonomous Period and contacts a Blue Robot. The second Blue Robot contacts the first Blue Robot but not the Red Robot. The first Blue Robot Scores as planned, but the Scoring of the second Blue Robot is affected, in the judgment of the Referees. Is there a penalty assigned to Red?<br>
A: The Game Design Committee (GDC) could have written rule &lt;GS5&gt; such that any ingress into the opposing Alliance Area during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period results in a Major Penalty. The GDC felt that this is too fine a line to draw during the Autonomous Period where Robot behaviors can be unpredictable due to collisions. The GDC granted Referees the flexibility to assess the circumstances of the early ingress and to use their judgment to excuse a Penalty for actions that are inadvertent and inconsequential. The example described in the question states that in the judgment of the Referees, the early entry of the Robot into the opposing Alliance Area caused the offending Alliance to affect scoring (i.e., gain an advantage). Per the Game Design Committee's guidance provided with rule &lt;RS5&gt;, the Referees should award a Major Penalty to the Red Alliance.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a Robot crosses into the opposing Alliance Area during the first 10 seconds of the Autonomous Period and contacts both Robots on the opposing Alliance and affects the Scoring of both Robots, are two penalties assessed or just one?<br>
A: The consequence for violating rule &lt;GS5&gt; is one Major Penalty.<br>
<br>
Game Design Committee Recommendation: Teams should not make use of the example in this question as a planned strategy. Intentionally violating rule &lt;GS5&gt; to keep the opposing Alliance from scoring even more points than the value of the Penalty is likely to be viewed by Referees as Egregious Behavior and a violation of rule &lt;G25&gt;. The consequence for violating rule &lt;G25&gt; is an additional Major Penalty and possible Disqualification.</div></div><hr>

A: One Penalty is assessed for each violation of rule &lt;GS5&gt;. In the stated example, two Robots violated the rule and each Robot will receive a Major Penalty for a combined total of 80 Penalty points.</div></div><hr>

A: One Major Penalty should be assessed for the scenario described in the question.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q1: Rule 1.5.4.2 says that only the first trigger of the All-Clear signal counts. Is this still true if there is a &lt;GS18&gt; violation? <br>
<br>
Q2: That is, if a Robot rotates the All Clear Signal before End Game in violation of &lt;GS18&gt;, can the opposing Robot rotate the All Clear Signal on the same Mountain and earn points?<br>
A1: No.<br>
<br>
A2: Yes, for example, if a Red Alliance Robot contacts the All Clear Signal, Pull-up Bar or the Cliff Low Bar before the End Game in violation of rule &lt;GS18&gt;, a Blue Alliance Robot may rotate the All Clear Signal on the same Mountain and earn points.</div></div><hr>

A: No, this is not a violation of rule &lt;GS10&gt;.<br>
<br>
Game Design Committee Warning: Intentionally depositing Debris into an opposing Alliance Mountain Climbing Area is considered to be a strategy that Blocks Access and violates rule &lt;GS9&gt;. Inadvertently depositing Debris into an opposing Alliance Mountain Climbing Area during the act of Scoring into a Mountain Goal is allowed.</div></div><hr>

A: Yes.<br>
<br>
Game Design Committee Warning: Referees may invoke rule &lt;S1&gt;, Playing Field Damage penalties, for the scenario described in the question.</div></div><hr>

A: In general, the described scenario is a violation of rule &lt;GS11&gt; because of the consequential contact with the opposing Alliance Robot. However, Referees will use their judgment and they have the option to invoke rule &lt;G17&gt; and forgive the &lt;GS11&gt; rule violation.</div></div><hr>

A: The first Robot to rotate the corresponding Alliance color baton upward into an approximate vertical orientation earns twenty points for the Alliance indicated by the color of the baton as specified in the All Clear Signal scoring section 1.5.4.2. In the scenario described in the question, the Red Alliance Robot is the first Robot to rotate the All Clear Signal in its favor (i.e., the red color baton is approximately vertical). The Red Alliance should be awarded the All Clear Signal points for the Mountain.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Q2: For example, if the robot is precariously perched on the Mountain and unable to be driven off safely without risk of tipping or damage (in the judgment of the Head Referee), would the robot be repositioned under &lt;G10&gt;?<br>
<br>
Q3: For a more extreme example, could a team design a one-way mechanism for use during the Autonomous Period and depend on the Head Referee to move the Robot off the Mountain so that the Robot could participate in the Driver-Controlled portion of the Match?<br>
A1: The Head Referee will make adjustments to a Robot's position and orientation when adjustments are deemed necessary to enable a Robot to participate in the Driver-Controlled portion of the Match.<br>
<br>
A2: This is a judgment call to be made the the Head Referee.<br>
<br>
A3: No.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider the case when a Blue Robot is Disabled and Blocking Access to the Red Mountain Climbing Area on the Red side of the Playing Field. In this case, the Red Robot may be unable to trigger the Red Climbers. Under &lt;GS12&gt;, the Red Robot can proceed to the Mountain on the Blue side of the Playing Field and climb on the Blue Mountain Climbing Area. Can the Red Robot also trigger the Blue Climbers and earn points for Red?<br>
A: The Red Alliance Robot is allowed to engage the triggers for the Blue Alliance Zip Line Climbers. However, the Zip Line Climber points will be awarded to the Blue Alliance. Zip Line Climbers are Alliance specific and scoring isn't affected by which Alliance Robot activates the Zip Line Trigger as specified in section 1.5.3.2.</div></div><hr>

A circumstance may arise, particularly near the End Game, when the functioning Blue Robot and a Red Robot both wish to access the same Blue Mountain Climbing Area that either is allowed to climb. Does the functioning Blue Robot have to give the right of way to the Red Robot if neither is contacting the Blue Mountain Climbing Area and the Blue Robot can get there first?<br>
A: The functioning Blue Alliance Robot does not have to give the right of way to the Red Alliance Robot in the scenario described in the question.</div></div><hr>

Q2: If the Red Robot chooses to climb the Mountain on the Blue side of the field, can the functioning Blue Robot precede the Red Robot and trigger the Climbers and earn points for Blue? Assume no contact between the Robots and therefore no &lt;GS11&gt; violation<br>
A1: The functioning Blue Alliance Robot risks incurring a penalty for violating rule &lt;GS9&gt;, Blocking Access.<br>
<br>
A2: The functioning Blue Alliance Robot may enter its own Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area and is eligible for all of the scoring tasks if the Mountain Climbing Area isn't already occupied by a Red Alliance Robot. The Red Alliance Robot that is attempting to follow the Blue Alliance Robot Into the Blue Alliance Climbing Area is not protected by rule &lt;GS12&gt; because the Blue Alliance Robot is already In the Blue Alliance Mountain Climbing Area.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A2: Yes, Robots are not allowed to Intentionally de-Score Debris from Mountain Goals. See rule &lt;GS15&gt; for the complete details.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since rule G19 gives a zero score to scoring elements in contact with the robot and G21 states that debris controlled by the robot are considered part of the robot.  Is it true that an alliance robot touching any debris in that alliances mountain goal at the time of scoring, removes all potential scored points from that mountain goal and not just the debris being directly touched by the robot?<br>
A: The short answer is no. Debris that are touching a Robot on the corresponding Alliance for the Goal have zero Score value per rule &lt;G19&gt;. The intent of the Game Design Committee is not to use rule &lt;G21&gt; to further extend the &lt;G19&gt; contact rule to include additional Debris in the Goal; just the Debris in direct contact with the Robot have zero score value. Debris that are not directly touching the Robot will be recorded as Scored by the Referees.</div></div><hr>

This could occur in Autonomous or Tele-Op if other robots drop theirs.<br>
A: Yes, Robots on booth Alliances are allowed to pick up a Climber that isn't in a Shelter or attached to a Zip Line and Score the Climber in a Shelter during the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the video it shows the robot throwing debris into the high goal while being on the floor. In the game manual it states that you have to be located on the mountain to release the mid and high climbers and score in the mid and high goals. I know the game manual trumps the game video but I would like to know for sure. Thanks!<br>
A: You are correct, some of the Mountain Scoring constraints are not accurately depicted in the game animation. The Game Manual and the FTC Q&amp;A Forum are the only official sources for game rules. The game animation is a fun and brief overview of the game that should not be relied upon to develop strategies for playing the game and designing Robots.<br>
<br>
Rule &lt;GS13&gt; requires Robots to be On the Mountain and above a two inch buffer Area to attach to or be Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar, Score Debris In the Mid Zone and High Zone Goals, claim the All Clear Signal, and release Zip Line Climbers with the Mid and High Zone Triggers.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q1: GS12 says that if a disabled blue robot is blocking an opposing alliance's access to its red side of a mountain, the opposing alliance's red robots can access the mountain through the other side.  How will GS9 be enforced in this case?  Do ONLY the opposing alliance red robots get access to the other (blue) side of the mountain, or can both alliances access the other side?<br>
Q2: Can one robot (from either alliance) then stay on that side of the mountain and prevent the other robot from gaining full access? For example, one blue robot dies in front of the red side of a mountain. Now the other blue robot and both red robots can enter the blue side of that mountain. Can a red robot sit on the blue side of that mountain to prevent the other blue robot from reaching the mid and high goals? <br>
Q3: Can the other blue robot sit on the blue side of the mountain to prevent either of the red robots from reaching the mid and high goals.<br>
A1: First of all, rule &lt;GS12&gt; allows one Robot from the affected [disadvantaged] Alliance to enter an opposing Alliance Mountain Climbing Area that isn't already occupied by a Robot on either Mountain. The affected Robots are not limited to just accessing the "other side" of the blocked Mountain as stated in the question. In the scenario described in the question, Robots on both Alliances may access a Blue Mountain Climbing Area that isn't already occupied by a Blue Alliance Robot.<br>
<br>
A2: Yes, a Robot may Park on an allowed Mountain Climbing Area and prevent other Robots from accessing that Climbing Area. In the example described in the question, the Red Alliance Robot can Park On the Blue Climbing Area to prevent the functional Blue Alliance Robot from accessing the Area. However, the Blocking Access Rule, &lt;GS9&gt;, would prevent the Red Robot from Parking Off of the Mountain and Blocking a Blue Alliance Robot from Accessing the Blue Climbing Area.<br>
<br>
A3: Yes.</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello!  Looks like we may be one of the first question askers.  Thanks for what looks like a great game this year.<br>
<br>
We understand the language related to a hang that will score points [from 1.5.4.1]:<br>
"Cliff Pull-up Bar – A Robot Fully Supported (i.e. hanging) by the Cliff Pull-up Bar earns eighty points for its Alliance. Robots may touch the Cliff Vertical Divider, rest against the Cliff Low Bar, and be in contact with an opposing Alliance Robot if the contact is Inadvertent and Inconsequential. The intent of this Scoring achievement is for the Cliff Pull-up Bar to support the Robot’s weight. If the Cliff Vertical Divider, Cliff Low Bar and the opposing Alliance Robot are removed from the Mountain, a Robot that is Fully Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar would not fall from the Cliff."<br>
<br>
But to clarify contact with the Cliff Low Bar - given that the Low Bar is only 15" from the Pull-up Bar, you could imagine many robot designs requiring some limited contact with the Cliff Low Bar on every attempted hang.  If by reasonable observation the Cliff Pull-up Bar supports the robot's full weight (complying with the concept that by removing the Low Bar the Robot will not fall), but the Low Bar is simply "rested on" laterally by the robot, is that a hang that would score eighty points?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
Team 6705/Motorbolts<br>
A: Yes, a Robot that is laterally resting against the Cliff Low Bar remains eligible to earn eighty points for the Cliff Pull-up Bar achievement. The Cliff Low Bar is a safety feature to prevent Robots from exiting the Playing Field through the open Mountain Cliff Area below the Pull-up Bar. The Game Design Committee expects that some Robots will rest laterally against the Cliff Low Bar while hanging from the Cliff Pull-up Bar.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-25-2015, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is a robot permitted to start the match parked in their Beacon repair zone or Floor Goal, assuming that they are touching the perimeter wall?<br>
A: No, Robots are required to be in contact with the Playing Field wall that is adjacent to their Alliance station as described in section 1.5.1.b in the Game Manual Part 2. Figure 1.3-1 in the Game Manual Part 2 is an overhead view of the Playing Field that shows the locations of the Beacon Repair Zones and Floor Goals are not next to the Alliance Stations, they are along the Playing Field wall that is towards the audience. See section 1.5.1 and rule &lt;G2&gt; for more details about pre-match robot setup.</div></div><hr>

In both scenarios, the improper scoring is not intentional, but rather a consequence of the Climbers and debris being mixed on the floor.<br>
A1: No Penalty is assessed and no points are Scored for a Climber In a Mountain Goal.<br>
<br>
A2: No Penalty is assessed and no points are Scored for Debris In a Shelter.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-27-2015, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading over the rule book according to rule 1.5.1 Pre-Match f. the pre-loaded climbers may be placed on the floor as long as they are touching the robot. So it must be legal to place the climbers against the side of a robot, but would it be legal for them to extend out of the 18 inch cube?<br>
A: Yes, rule &lt;G3&gt; allows pre-loaded Scoring Elements to extend outside the 18-inch cube starting volume.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GS7 says "Plowing (bumping, moving, touching, etc.) Debris located on the Playing Field floor is allowed and does not count towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint if the movement of the Debris is not purposeful. Debris will be scattered around the Playing Field and some interaction between Robots and Debris is expected and should not be Penalized, provided that the Robot is not deliberately Controlling the Debris."<br>
<br>
Say we have collected 5 pieces of debris and are now moving towards one of our Mountains, and we find 10 pieces of debris lying in our way on the floor at the base of our Mountain. May we push the floor debris out of the way to clear a path to our Mountain if the moving of the floor debris serves no other purpose other than clearing the path?  This would require "deliberately Controlling the Debris" by pushing or plowing it, and it would be "purposeful" (to clear the path at base of the Mountain), and thus we would be temporarily "controlling" the 5 pieces of collected debris plus extra debris on the floor. We are hoping this type of purposeful motion would be allowed without resulting in a penalty.<br>
A: The intent of the Game Design Committee is to allow Robots to clear Debris from blocking access to the Mountain without incurring &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties; provided that the Debris is not moved to block the entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain or to Score in a Floor Goal. The Robot action described in the post is allowed.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GS7 says "Plowing (bumping, moving, touching, etc.) Debris located on the Playing Field floor is allowed and does not count towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint if the movement of the Debris is not purposeful. Debris will be scattered around the Playing Field and some interaction between Robots and Debris is expected and should not be Penalized, provided that the Robot is not deliberately Controlling the Debris."<br>
<br>
If a team is plowing through debris to get to a Mountain and to drive up the Mountain, and a piece of debris gets plowed up onto the surface of the Mountain as the robot drives onto the Mountain, is this still allowed or is it now a penalty because the plowed debris is no longer on the Playing Field floor?<br>
A: The scenario described in the question does not violate a rule. The intent specified for rule &lt;GS7&gt; in the Game Manual Part 2 states that plowing through Debris is allowed.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re GS7: Can you clarify the difference between allowed "Plowing (bumping, moving, touching, etc.) Debris located on the Playing Field floor is allowed... if the movement of the Debris is not purposeful" and disallowed "Controlling: An object is considered to be Controlled by a Robot if the object is following the movement of the Robot. Examples are: pushing an object on the Playing Field floor..."<br>
<br>
Q1: To be clear what we are asking about, the following questions arose: Say we possess 4-5 debris elements and want to score them on a Mountain. The only clear path to get to the Mountain has 10-20 or more debris elements on the floor. Can we drive towards the Mountain, possibly pushing some of the floor debris with us with no advantageous purpose? <br>
Q2: Or do we have to be actively plowing them to a side or bumping, moving, or touching them out of the way as we go? <br>
Q3: Say 10-20 elements have collected at the base of 1 Mountain. Can we push them with us as we climb the Mountain if the pushing serves no advantageous purpose for us as we climb the Mountain? <br>
Q4: Can we plow them to the side as we attempt to climb the Mountain? <br>
Q5: Can we inadvertently bump, move, or touch them out of the way as we go? <br>
Q6: Our questions essentially come down to the difference between plowing and pushing, and what types of movement will be declared "purposeful" and what types will not?<br>
A1:Yes, this action is considered plowing and rule &lt;GS7&gt; specifically allows plowing that is not purposeful.<br>
<br>
A2: No.<br>
<br>
A3: Yes.<br>
<br>
A4: Yes, rule &lt;GS7&gt; specifically allows plowing that is not purposeful.<br>
<br>
A5: Yes, rule &lt;GS7&gt; specifically allows inadvertent bumping, moving and touching Debris.<br>
<br>
A6: Referees will observe Robot actions and use their judgment to determine if the movement of Debris by a Robot is a purposeful (i.e. planned) strategy to Control more than five Debris. In addition to Robot actions, Robot design may play a role in the determination of Controlled versus uncontrolled movement of Debris. For example, Referees are more likely to rule that a Robot with a "U" shape that is likely to trap Debris inside the "U" is intentionally Controlling Debris as it moves through Areas containing Debris. Robots that have a surface that is designed to shed (i.e. discard) Debris is less likely to be viewed as purposefully Controlling Debris as the Robot moves about the Playing Field.</div></div><hr>

A1: No, rule &lt;GS12&gt; does not specify changes to methods of Scoring.<br>
<br>
A2: Robots are allowed to place Scoring Elements into any Goal. Points are awarded to Alliances based on the Goal, not the Alliance of the Robot that placed Scoring Elements into the Goal. For example, all Debris Inside the Blue Alliance Mountain Goals are Scored for the Blue Alliance, regardless of which Alliance Robot placed Debris into the Blue Alliance Mountain Goals. See sections 1.5.2.2, 1.5.3.1, and 1.5.3.3 for justification of this answer.<br>
<br>
A3: Rule &lt;GS12&gt; does not change how referees Score the All Clear Signal. The first baton that rotates into an approximate vertical orientation during the End Game earns twenty points for the Alliance indicated by the color of the baton.

Q2: Doesn't your drive train have to be above the 2" white gaffers tape mark on the bottom of the mountain to be able to score in the mid &amp; high goals and to release the mid &amp; high climbers?<br>
A1: Yes, because scoring from the specified location on the Playing Field into the Mid and High Zone Goals isn't allowed by rule &lt;GS13&gt;.

<br>
(For these examples climber 1 represents the low release, climber 2 the mid release and climber 3 the high release)<br>
<br>
Q2: Scenario 1: Climber 1 is not released but 2 and 3 are. They aren't able to slide down the cable to the bottom because climber 1 hasn't been released yet. Do you receive a score of 40 points for the 2 climbers released even though they didn't slide down or is it 0 points since climber 1 is blocking them from sliding down?<br>
<br>
Q3: Scenario 2: Climber 1 is not released but 2 and 3 are. However, the release for the 3rd climber and the paddle that the robot pushes for the 3rd climber have both fallen back into a non released position through the shaking of the mountain during game play. From looking at the climbers you can see that climber 3 has fallen down the cord a little bit and is resting against the back of climber 2. Will we receive 40 points total for climber 2 &amp; 3, 20 points since the release and paddle don't appear engaged, or 0 points because climber 1 hasn't been released and therefore all 3 climbers haven't fallen?<br>
A1: Climbers are not required to be released in a specific order. Referees will record the state of the Climbers at the conclusion of the Driver-Controlled Period as described in rule &lt;G12&gt;.<br>
<br>
A2: Climbers released in accordance with rule &lt;GS14&gt; will be recorded as Scored by the referees. This scenario is addressed in the Game Manual with rule &lt;GS14&gt;a. If Triggers were used to release Climbers 2 and 3, both Climbers would be recorded as Scored.<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">10-10-2015, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The FIRST RES-Q Game Manual Part 2 contains 49 game rules plus detailed descriptions of Scoring and game play. The Game Design Committee recognizes that this is a lot for teams to learn and consequently, early in the season we answered many Q&amp;A forum questions from teams that were clearly addressed in the Game Manual. If teams continue to ask basic questions, the Q&amp;A forum will become very long and with length, it becomes less likely that the Game Design Committee's thoughtful answers will be read by everyone. A byproduct of a forum with a lot of posts is questions that do enhance everyone's understanding of the game will be lost in the noise of the questions about topics that are already clearly addressed in the Game Manual. <br>

Would that be against the rules and considered ramming into wall? This was allowed in FLL, but we are rookie FTC, hence the question. <br>
Alternately, we could use some sensors, but if allowed, kids are thinking of doing that.<br>
A: Robots may use the Playing Field perimeter wall to "square up" because there is no rule in the Game Manual that prohibits this action. Keep in mind the Playing Field damage rule, &lt;S1&gt;, while designing your Robot's "square up" maneuver.</div></div><hr>

Would the debris count for the blue team or not?  Consider that the blue team might have been able to legally score in the goal except for the illegal debris taking up space in the goal.<br>
A: Debris illegally Scored by the Red Alliance into the Blue Alliance Mountain Goal will count as Scored for the Blue Alliance if the Debris remains in the Goal at the conclusion of the Match. The intent of rule &lt;GS13&gt; is to require Robots to climb onto the Mountain to earn points for their Alliance when completing the Mountain Scoring achievements specified in the rule.<br>

A: Section 1.5.3.4 in the Game Manual Part 2 clearly states that Robots earn points based on where they are Parked On the Mountain at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period. The locations of the Robot prior to the end of the Driver-Controlled Period do not earn points that contribute to the Alliance's Match Score.<br>
<br>
The same principle is applied to the Autonomous Period. Section 1.5.2.3 in the Game Manual Part 2 states that Robots earn points based on where they are Parked On the Mountain at the end of the Autonomous Period.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">10-20-2015, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a question regarding &lt;GS14&gt;. We understand that the respective Zip Line Climbers may only be released by using the respective Triggers. We also understand that the circumstances may warrant the points for the Zip Line Climbers to be counted if the Trigger appears to be engaged even if the Climber does not fall.<br>
<br>
Here is the basis for our question, we understand &lt;GS14&gt; and &lt;GS14&gt; part (a). However, (b) is not clear. According to the wording in (b), if the trigger is rotated to a scored position (such that the Zip Line Climber could slide down the Zip Line for points), and then rotates back from its Scored position to the original Pre-Match position after the Climber has been released, we as a blue alliance robot, are allowed to trigger all three blue alliance triggers for 20pts/trigger for 60 points. Additionally, if we also rotated the blue alliance triggers from the scored position back to the pre-match position, we could gain an additional 20pts/trigger for an additional 60 points. This would be 120 points total, 60 points by engaging all 3 blue triggers to release the climbers and another 60 points for resetting the blue triggers.<br>
<br>
Q: Can you please confirm that we are allowed to rotate the Triggers back towards their pre-match position for points in addition to engaging the Triggers for a possible total of 120 points from a single alliance's triggers?<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
  The Synergists-#7104<br>
A: The scenario described in the question is not a correct interpretation of rule &lt;GS14&gt;. This rule states that Zip Line Climbers have a Score value only at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period. Per Rule &lt;G12&gt;, referees will look at the states of the Zip Line Climbers and Triggers at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period after all objects on the Playing field have come to rest and apply the conditions specified in rule &lt;GS14&gt; to determine the Score value of the Zip Line Climbers. Each Zip Line Climber has a maximum potential Score value of 20 points. If all three Zip Line Climbers satisfy the conditions stated in rule &lt;GS14&gt;, the Alliance will earn 60 points.<br>
<br>
When the Game Design Committee created FIRST RES-Q, the intent was for Robots to engage Triggers that release Climbers to slide down the Zip Line. The Game Design Committee anticipates that occasionally during match play, Robot interactions with the Mountain, Playing Field Wall, etc. may cause the Zip Line Climbers to release without Robots engaging the Triggers. Also, on occasion, engaged Triggers may not release Climbers. The statement in the rule that "referees will credit an Alliance for releasing Climbers if the Triggers are engaged after Climbers have been released by other means" and parts a) and b) of the rule provide guidance for awarding points to an Alliance when these "other factors" come into play.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Point levels are based on the Area of the Mountain that Supports the Robot. The Score is not dependent upon being In or Completely In an Area.<br>
<br>
Q1: So then, if a robot's front wheels cross the first churro and comes to rest so that the churro is holding the robot from falling back to the low zone, is that considered "supported" by the mid zone scoring area? <br>
Q2: Or would all wheels of the robot have to cross the first churro to be considered supported by the mid zone?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>
A1: The Robot is partially Supported by the Mountain Mid-Zone and I will assume that the rest of the Robot is Supported by the Low-Zone. In this scenario, the Robot earns 10 Points for Parking in the Mountain Low-Zone. The rationale is derived from sections 1.5.2.3 and 1.5.3.4:<br>
 <br>
"Robots earn points for the lowest zone that they are On. For Example, a Robot that is On both the Low- and Mid-Zones earns points for the Low-Zone achievement."<br>
<br>
A2: The first churro is the lowest point for the Mountain Mid-Zone as shown in Figure 1.3-3 in the Game Manual Part 2. The Robot needs to be Completely Supported by the Mountain's first churro or higher on the Mountain to earn points for Parking in the Mid-Zone.</div></div><hr>

A: There is insufficient information included in the question for the Game Design Committee to reply with a yes or no answer.<br>
<br>
If the Robot deploys a ramp by detaching a part from the Robot, this violates rule &lt;G13&gt;.<br>

If the ramp remains attached to the Robot, it is therefore part of the Robot.

<br>
Q: If our robot utilizes a device which "reaches" up the mountain to score in the high scoring bucket, while our robot is parked on the mountain above the 2in. tape, and this device bumps into the Cliff Low Bar, but makes no attempt to "grasp, grapple, etc." that bar, will this be considered "Inconsequential contact" as stated in GS-18?<br>
<br>
Thank you for clarification.<br>
<br>
- The Lazybotts<br>
A: Rule &lt;GS18&gt; states that prior to the start of the End Game, "Inadvertent and Inconsequential contact made with the All Clear Signal, the Pull-up Bar, or the Cliff Low Bar will not result in a Penalty of loss of Score" for End Game achievements. Without observing the Robot's actions, the Game Design Committee can not rule if the scenario described in the question is both Inadvertent and Inconsequential. Referees observing the Robot's actions will make the determination if the contact is Inadvertent and Inconsequential.<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to assume that occasional bumping into the Cliff Low Bar is likely to be viewed as an Inadvertent and Inconsequential action. If bumping into the Cliff Low Bar is a strategy to help with Scoring Debris into the Mountain Goal, this action is not Inadvertent and Inconsequential and it should affect the Robot's eligibility to perform the End Game achievements. This determination will be made by the referees observing the match.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">10-27-2015, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine a robot that could "plow" through a pile of debris. This robot has a mechanism that allows one type of debris to enter the robot's main body (for collection and scoring), while the other type is merely pushed (aka. plowed) along in front of the robot. This mechanism does not grab, grasp, or grapple any debris in any way shape or form, nor does it have a "u" or a "v" shape. The debris being pushed are not in possession of the robot (the robot could spin or back up without the debris following the robot's path), nor are they being purposefully moved in order to hoard them or place them in a scoring position.<br>
<br>
Q: Would such a robot be legal under GS7?<br>
A: Rule &lt;GS7&gt; states that "plowing" through Debris located on the Playing Field floor is allowed and does not count towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint if the movement of the Debris is not purposeful. The scenario described in the question appears to satisfy the "plowing" exception to the rule. However, the referees watching the actions of the robot will determine if the robot is plowing through Debris or if it is deliberately Controlling the Debris. Of course, the Debris that the robot collects counts towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint.</div></div><hr>

Q2: If so, would a robot that simply climbs the mountain too far during autonomous and runs into the Cliff Low Bar constitute a penalty of zero score for the end game pull up bar and all clear beacon?<br>
A1: Yes, section 1.6 of the Game Manual Part 2 states that "rules apply to all periods of play unless specifically called out as omitted." The game manual doesn't exempt the enforcement of rule &lt;GS18&gt; during the Autonomous Period.<br>
<br>
A2: Referees watching the match will determine if the contact with the Cliff Low Bar violates rule &lt;GS18&gt;. The rule has a provision that Inadvertent and Inconsequential contact made with the All Clear Signal, the Pull-up Bar, or the Cliff Low Bar will not result in a Penalty. The purpose of the Cliff Low Bar is to prevent robots from exiting the Playing Field through the Cliff Zone opening in the Mountain. Precise control of Robot travel on the Mountain during the Autonomous Period will be difficult and referees should take this into consideration when considering if an action is Inadvertent or Inconsequential. A Robot bumping into the Cliff Low Bar safety feature during the Autonomous Period is likely to be viewed by referees as an Inadvertent action and Inconsequential to game play. If this is the case, no Penalty will be assessed.</div></div><hr>

-----------------<br>
<br>
Q: To clarify, does that mean, prior to the beginning of the match, one team can collect and place all four climbers for that alliance on their robot (before start of autonomous)?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
A: No, one Team may not collect and place all four of their Alliance's Climbers on one Robot before the start of the Autonomous Period. The original question in post #23 asked if the Climbers can be collected from an Alliance Partner during the Autonomous Period. Section 1.5.1.f specifies that "teams may pre-load up to two Climbers per Robot."</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">10-27-2015, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Asking for clarification for the illustration in Game Manual Part 2, Figure 1.3-3:<br>
<br>
Q1:  Is the third churro from the bottom considered to be part of the Mid-Zone or the High-Zone?  (A robot supported only by the third churro and higher would be considered to be parked in which zone?)<br>
<br>
Q2:  Is the mountain panel above the third churro part of the Mid-Zone?  (Can a robot touching any part of the mountain panel above the third churro be parked in the High-Zone?)<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
A1: The arrow indicating the top of the Mid-Zone points directly at the third churro from the bottom of the Mountain. Therefore, this churro is the top most part of the Mountain Mid-Zone. A Robot supported by the third churro from the bottom of the Mountain and also Supported by the Area higher on the Mountain is Parked in the Mid-Zone. Sections 1.5.2.3 and 1.5.3.4 states that Robots earn points for the lowest zone that they are On. In this example, the Mid-Zone is the lowest zone that the Robot is On.<br>
<br>
A2: No, the portion of the Mountain panel that is above the third churro from the bottom of the Mountain is part of the High-Zone. Imagine a line that is perpendicular to the Mountain panel and extending towards the upper edge of the churro; this line defines the separation of the Mid- and High-Zones on the Mountain panel. A Robot that is Supported by the portion of the Mountain panel that is above the third churro from the bottom of the Mountain or higher is eligible for Parking In the High-Zone, provided that all of the other requirements for Parking in the High-Zone are satisfied.</div></div><hr>

Q: The rulebook states that the robot must be on the ramp in order to make contact with the pull-up bar.  Does the robot need to be entirely on the ramp, as in, all four wheels not touching the ground?  Or do just some (like, two) wheels have to be on the ramp?<br>
Can I touch the pull-up bar if my rear two wheels are on the ground, but my front two are on the ramp?<br>
Thanks.<br>
A: Rule &lt;GS13&gt; requires the Robot to be Completely On the Mountain and the Robot's [entire] drivetrain (e.g. wheels, tread) must only be in contact with the portions of the Mountain above the two inch tall buffer Area that is defined by white gaffers tape located at the bottom/entrance to the Mountain ramp in order to attach to or be Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar. A Robot that makes contact with the Cliff Pull-up Bar while any portion of its drivetrain is on the Playing Field soft foam tiles, violates rule &lt;GS13&gt;. Also keep in mind rule &lt;GS18&gt;, Robots can not make contact with the Cliff Pull-up Bar until the End Game.</div></div><hr>

In the Game Manual Part 2, it does state that any debris in the floor goal in the beginning of the match is not removed by field personnel, however our question is whether or not these pieces of debris should count towards scoring.<br>
A: Yes, Debris in the Floor Goal as a result of the pre-Match dispersion of the Debris onto the Playing Field are eligible to be Scored at the end of the Match if they are still in the Floor Goal at the end of the Match. Keep in mind that rule &lt;GS15&gt; allows Robots to de-Score Debris from the Floor Goal.</div></div><hr>

A: During the End Game Period, Robots may use the Cliff Low Bar as a support aid while in the act of performing a Pull-up maneuver. Referees determine the Score value of the Pull-up after the match ends. At the end of the Match, the Robot may touch the Cliff Low Bar without Penalty, provided that the conditions specified in section 1.5.4.1 are satisfied.<br>
<br>
Section 1.5.4.1 states that Robots may "rest against the Cliff Low Bar." Section 1.5.4.1 also states that "the intent of the Scoring achievement is for the Cliff Pull-up Bar to support the Robot's weight. If the Cliff Vertical Divider, Cliff Low Bar and the opposing Alliance Robot are removed from the Mountain, a Robot that is Fully Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar would not fall from the Cliff."</div></div><hr>

<br>
We are trying to understand the nuances between the interactions with sport stop and the field being completely at rest. According to Game Manual Part 2, "The Driver-Controlled Score is based on the position of Scoring Elements, All Clear Signals, and Robots at the end of the Match after all objects have come to rest" (1.5.3). However, due to the nature of sport stop, it is difficult to tell if it is the fact that a robot is being controlled or the sudden termination of movement is the cause of scoring. <br>
Q1: If a robot were to be entirely stopped or uncontrolled before the buzzer, but a piece of debris were to fall into a goal as the buzzer signifying the end of a match sounded, shouldn't that debris be counted as scored? <br>
Q2: How should situations like this be judged?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
FTC Team 4290<br>
A1: Yes, Debris that enters a Goal after a Robot is "entirely stopped or uncontrolled before the buzzer" is eligible to be counted as Scored.<br>
<br>
A2: Robots are expected to stop playing the game within a reasonable human reaction time following the start of the game sound signaling the end of the Period. Drive Teams should make their best effort to stop game play immediately when the end of Period game sound begins. Before the Penalties described in rule &lt;G8&gt; come into play, referees will use their discretion to give Drive Teams a reasonable length of time to stop playing the game. The Game Design Committee recommends an approximate one second grace period following the conclusion of the game sound signaling the end of the Period for Robots to stop "playing the game."</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">11-09-2015, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of questions about the Mountain Goal baskets and rule GS15.<br>
<br>
Q1: Assume the mountain goal baskets are empty. If while driving up the mountain or trying to hang, the robot accidently bumps the basket such that it falls off. Is this a penalty? What happens to the basket since it will no longer be able to score in it?<br>
<br>
Q2: Assume basket has debris in it. What is the consequence if a robot accidently bumps the basket such that it falls off?<br>
<br>
From reading GS15, "The intent of this rule is to prevent intentional de-Scoring. Debris that fall out of a Mountain Goal due to Robots climbing the Mountain, bumping into a Mountain Goal or Mountain, placing Debris into a Mountain Goal, engaging Triggers, etc. will not be Penalized" we believe there is no penalty in both cases but it is unclear about what happens to the baskets.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>
Team 5073<br>
A1: The Mountain Goals are attached to the Mountain with zip ties. It is unlikely that an "accidental bump" by a Robot will cause a Mountain Goal to "fall off."<br>
<br>
Causing a properly attached Mountain Goal to "fall off" the Mountain is damage to the Playing Field and the Penalty consequence is specified in rule &lt;S1&gt;. The Match will be replayed per rule &lt;G24&gt; if the missed Scoring opportunity caused by the absent Mountain Goal was likely to have impacted which Alliance won the Match. Field Personnel will replace damaged Game Elements after the Match Score has been recorded by the referees. <br>
<br>
A2: In addition to the consequences listed in A1 for causing a Mountain Goal to fall off the Mountain, the offending Alliance will incur a Major Penalty for each de-Scored Debris. See rule &lt;GS15&gt; for a complete description of the de-Scoring Debris rule.<br>
<br>
The intent of rule &lt;GS15&gt; is to prevent intentional de-Scoring of Debris. Debris that falls out of a Mountain Goal due to Robots climbing the Mountain, bumping into a Mountain Goal or Mountain, placing Debris into a Mountain Goal, engaging Triggers, etc. will not be Penalized. Bumping into a Mountain Goal with sufficient force to dislodge a Goal that is zip tied to the Mountain isn't protected by the exception to rule &lt;GS15&gt; for unintentional de-Scoring while playing the game.</div></div><hr>

1. Using an arm or other mechanism pull your robot up to and using the Cliff Low Bar.<br>
2. From this new position extend and pull up again to the Cliff Bar<br>
<br>
Result: the robot is completely supported by the Cliff Bar, but is also resting on the Cliff Low Bar.<br>
A: Robots are allowed to touch, grab, attach, climb on, pull-up with, etc. the Cliff Low Bar during the End Game. The Pull-up Score is based on the location of the Robot at the end of the Match after all objects have come to rest. When the referees are recording the Score after the Match ends, Robots may rest against the Cliff Low bar and still earn points for a successful Pull-up; provided that the Robot is fully Supported by the Pull-up Bar. Robots using the Cliff Low Bar as a "step" for support after the Match ends should not earn Pull-up Score points.

<br>
Our team is using 180 degree 1/4 scale servos that were allowed last year. However, we are only getting around 160 degrees of motion, as explained in http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4461-Servos-with-new-Modern-Robotics-Hardware/page2 (http://this thread). When our robot is powered off, or powered on and not initialized, it fits within the 18" cube. However, after it is initialized, it extends past the 18", because the firmware of the Modern Robotics Servo Controller does not produce a PWM signal of the range needed to allow the programed min/max positions to match the servo's mechanical stops.<br>
<br>
Q: May we wait until the start of the Autonomous Period to initialize our Robot? Our robot does actually fit in an 18" cube, and the only reason it is not after initializing is due to range of the PWM signal from the servo controller.<br>
<br>
A: No, teams are required to press the Driver Station init button during the pre-match setup process.<br>
<br>
One remedy is to replace the legacy 180 degree servo with a different model servo that operates within the PWM signal range of the servo controller.</div></div><hr>

<br>
In post #65 (http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4629-Game-Rules-Answer-Thread&amp;p=20836&amp;viewfull=1#post20836) you state:<br>
<br>
Robots using the Cliff Low Bar as a "step" for support after the Match ends should not earn Pull-up Score points. Robots resting against the Cliff Low Bar like a person would lean against a wall is allowed for a successful Pull-up Score.<br>
<br>
This seems like it could be interpreted incorrectly by referees. The game manual specifically states that:<br>
<br>
If the Cliff Vertical Divider, Cliff Low Bar and the opposing Alliance Robot are removed from the Mountain, a Robot that is Fully Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar would not fall from the Cliff.<br>
<br>
So our interpretation is that even if a hanging robot is resting on top of the Low Cliff Bar "like a step", the hang would still count because if the Cliff Low Bar were "removed from the mountain" the hanging robot would "not fall from the cliff".<br>
<br>
Your clarification is appreciated.<br>

A: The Team's interpretation of the Cliff Pull-up Bar Support requirement in the Game Manual Part 2 Section 1.5.4.1 is incorrect.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">11-13-2015, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does &lt;GS7&gt; apply during the autonomous period?<br>
A: I am glad that you asked this question. Incorrect application of &lt;GS7&gt; during the Autonomous Period has the potential for "breaking the game." <br>
<br>
First of all, rule &lt;GS7&gt; applies the same way during the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods. The Game Design Committee's intent for this rule is to prevent game play strategies for Scoring or defense that involve the Control or Possession of mass quantities of Debris. A few examples of game play strategies that the rule IS intended to prevent are: <br>
<br>
a) Pushing or delivering more than five Debris into a Goal at one time.<br>
b) Pushing or delivering with a single act, more than five Debris into an Area to gain a strategic advantage (e.g. staging Debris for future Scoring into a Goal, defensive blocking access to an Area, etc.).<br>
c) Possessing more than five Debris at any time.<br>
<br>
Plowing through Debris without a strategic Scoring or defensive intent for the Debris is NOT subject to rule &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties. A few examples of Robot actions that the rule is NOT intended to prevent (i.e. the actions do not earn &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties) are:<br>
<br>
a) A Robot driving from its Match starting location to the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone;<br>
b) Plowing through Debris to gain access to the Mountain;<br>
c) Clearing Debris from blocking access to the Mountain; provided that the Debris is not moved to block the entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain or to Score in a Floor Goal.<br>
<br>
Referees observing the Match will use their judgment to determine if a Robot is plowing through Debris (allowed without incurring a penalty), or if there is a strategic Scoring or defensive intent that should incur &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties.<br>
<br>
Any Robot design can violate rule &lt;GS7&gt;, however, some Robot designs are more likely to violate rule &lt;GS7&gt;. For example, a "U" shaped Robot that collects Debris inside the "U" shape while driving around the Playing Field is not able to "plow" through Debris without Possessing Debris that enters the "U". In general, Debris inside the "U" shape will always count towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint. Robots with the following characteristics are more likely to be viewed as "plowing" through Debris if there is no obvious strategic Scoring or defensive intent:<br>
<br>
a) A straight bumper.<br>
b) A bumper surface shaped to passively shed Debris.<br>
c) Ground clearance for Debris to pass underneath and out the back of the Robot as it drives around the Playing Field.<br>
d) Active designs for dispersing Debris out of the way.<br>
<br>
One more item before closing out this post. Debris that are in a Scored state In the Floor Goal do not count towards the five Debris Possession/Control constraint while a Robot is in the act of Scoring additional Debris.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: The answer in post #31 was changed to match the answer provided in this post.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">11-16-2015, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rules explain that non-supportive contact with cliff elements at the completion of a pull-up is allowed as long as the robot is fully supported by the Pull-Up Bar, but no mention is made of such contact with the High Zone Goal.  May a robot be in non-supportive contact with the Mountain High Zone Goal (i.e. the side of the Goal) as long as it is fully supported by the Pull-Up Bar, and would remain supported if the Goal were removed?<br>
A: Yes, the Cliff Low Bar exception for contact during a Pull-up also applies to the entire Mountain High Zone Goal. <br>
<br>
Additional Guidance:<br>
1. Lateral support provided to the Robot by the High Zone Goal is allowed for a successful Pull-up. For example, a Robot may lean against the side of the of the High Zone Goal and remain eligible for a successful Pull-up.<br>
<br>
2. Vertical support provided to the Robot by the High Zone Goal is not allowed for a successful Pull-up. For example, a Robot that is supported by the top edge of a High Zone Goal's sidewall is not eligible for a successful Pull-up.<br>

Q2: And also what is the exact definition of 'control' when it comes to the debris?<br>
A1: Yes, teams may use legally constructed fans to "blow away" Debris. Fans must be properly guarded so that there is no possibility of the blades coming into contact with a person (team member, FTA, Ref, etc.) or the Playing Field (rule &lt;RG02.a&gt;). Robot Inspectors will be instructed to pay particular attention to fan based devices to insure they can be operated safely.<br>
<br>
A2: The term "Control" is defined in Section 1.4 of the Game Manual Part 2. "An object is considered to be Controlled by a Robot if the object is following the movement of the Robot. Examples are: pushing an object on the Playing Field floor, or holding or carrying an object."</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">11-17-2015, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are wondering what the Game Design Committee wanted for the distribution of the debris. If done by the Field Setup Manual they are poured down the mountain. Many get stuck on the charros and extra work is done to remove them. And sometimes a big pile up of the cubes happens that the base of the mountain creating a significant jam at the bottom of the mountain. If your autonomous goes by the base of the mountain, there is basically no way to get through. But in general our autonomous could go away from the mountain have a reasonably clear path.<br>
<br>
But due to the poor distribution and the struck debris, the field setup team started tossing the debris in from the sides. This created a more distributed debris but for most part blocked our autonomous from having any chance to get to the beacon. So we had to settle to just plowing through and hope to end up the floor goal area.<br>
<br>
Did the design committee mean for the debris (specifically the blocks) to be in a bigger concentration around the base of the mountain (like an avalanche) which allows for a little more clear path for autonomous by going away from the mountain or for the debris be reasonably distributed around the field.<br>
A: The "Field Setup Manual" is not the correct source for leaning how to introduce Debris onto the Playing Field. The "Field Reset Guide" describes the required way to introduce Debris onto the Playing Field. Following these instructions usually results in no Debris on the Mountain and Debris scattered throughout the Playing Field. Naturally, there will be a higher density of Blocks near the entrance to the Mountain where the Debris first enter the Playing Field. With a little practice, field personnel will master the proper technique for introducing Debris onto the Playing Field.<br>
<br>
FIRST asks all events to follow the procedure described in the "Field Reset Guide" so that we have consistency across all competitions.<br>

Last year,  the Field Control System program had the emergency stop ability.  May teams use their driver station to emergency stop their robot during the autonomous period and not re-start until tele-op?<br>
A: Any member of the Drive Team may use their Driver Station to stop the execution of their Robot's opmode during the Autonomous Period without Penalty if unexpected Robot behavior is a safety hazard. Unexpected Robot behavior in itself is not sufficient justification for the Team to stop their Robot's opmode; the Robot must be a safety hazard. A Robot that was stopped during the Autonomous Period to prevent damage to itself, other Robots, people, or the Playing Field may participate in the Driver-Controlled Period. The Drive Team should notify the Head Referee and Field Technical Advisor after stopping the execution of the Robot's opmode during the Autonomous Period.<br>
<br>
The Drive Team may not use a Driver Station to stop their Robot during the Autonomous Period as a game play strategy. If the Referees believe that stopping the Robot was a game play strategy, they will apply rule &lt;G25&gt; for Egregious Behavior and the Robot may not participate in the Driver-Controlled Period.</div></div><hr>

<br>
This warning is specific to depositing Debris into a Mountain Climbing area, and this warning does not discuss whether or not this also applies to the floor area immediately in front of a Mountain Climbing area.<br>
<br>
Q: Can teams intentionally deposit/push/plow debris on the floor immediately in front of opposing alliance Mountain entrance areas to make it difficult for the opposing alliance to enter their Mountains, or is this also considered Blocking Access to their Mountain entrance similar to the warning cited above?<br>
A: Robots may intentionally deposit/push/plow Debris on the Playing Field floor immediately in front of the opposing Alliance's Mountain entrance Area; subject to the limitations of the Debris Possession/Control rule &lt;GS7&gt;.<br>
<br>
Referees will closely watch Robots for violations of the five Debris Possession/Control rule when they are intentionally moving Debris to block the entrance to the opposing Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area.<br>
<br>
Robots that are clearing Debris away from Blocking Access to their Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area are not subject to the five Debris Possession/Control rule &lt;GS7&gt;; provided that the Debris is not moved to block the Playing Floor entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain or to Score in a Floor Goal.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Q1: If the blue robot places this blocker right above red mountain goal such that no debris could enter. Rule GS10 says this is shared space so no penalty there. Rule GS9 does not call out the mountain goals for blocking access.  Is it a legal or illegal to block the debris from entering one mountain goal?<br>
<br>
Assuming Q1 is illegal.<br>
Q2: What if the blocker only covers, 1/2 of the red mountain goal. Is this no longer a violation?<br>
Q3: What if the blocker fully covers above the red mountain goal, but it is 4 inches above it. So access if possible below it. Is this ok?<br>

Post 73 seems to allow non-supportive contact with the Mountain High Zone Goal area (which would include the churros) (as long as it is fully supported by the Pull-Up Bar, and would remain supported if the Goal were removed) while still qualifying for the pull-up score.  Post 76 seems to explicitly prohibit touching the Mountain High Zone Goal churros.   These posts seem to conflict, or is the distinction the GDC is making specifically related to the churro?<br>
A: There is no conflict between Posts #73 and #76. Post #73 allows contact with the Mountain High Zone Goal because the Goal extends into the Cliff Zone. Post #76 states that a Robot touching a churro located in the Mountain High-Zone is not eligible to earn points for performing a Pull-up. Contact with objects In the High Zone Area are not allowed for a valid Pull-up; except for the exclusion for the High Zone Goal.</div></div><hr>

Q2: We were also told that robots could not pull from the cliff low bar or the bar directly below the cliff low bar.  Again, I don't see any such rules posted in the game manuals. Is this climbing restriction correct?<br>

<br>
"Robots may start pulling themselves up the Mountain from any location on the Mountain and/or Playing Field Floor. "<br>
<br>
Q1: Based on this answer, is it correct to assume that our robot does not need to be completely above the 2" tape at the bottom of the mountain when we first make contact with the cliff pull-up bar when attempting to hang in endgame. <br>
<br>
Q2: For example, during endgame our robot would deploy a hook, via a linear slide, to the pull up bar then use a winch to pull our robot up the mountain and into a hanging position on the cliff. However, our drivetrain would not be above the 2" tape at the bottom of the mountain at the time our hooks first make contact with the pull up bar, but the drivetrain would be above the tape once we start winching the robot up the mountain.<br>

A1: The question in post #85 concerns restrictions for climbing the Mountain. There is no reference in the question to performing the End Game achievements. The answer in Post #85 would have been different if the question asked about performing an End Game Pull-up.<br>
<br>
Robots attempting the Pull-up achievement during the End Game are required to comply with rules &lt;GS10&gt;, &lt;GS11&gt;, &lt;GS13&gt;, &lt;GS18&gt;, &lt;GS21&gt;, Section 1.5.4, etc. Rule &lt;GS13&gt; requires robots to be Completely On the Mountain and the Robot's drivetrain must only be in contact with the portions of the Mountain above the two inch tall buffer Area that is defined by white gaffers tape located at the bottom/entrance to the Mountain Ramp to attach to or be Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar.<br>

At a recent qualifying tournament, we were warned that a penalty would be assessed if the coach touched the phone during the driver-controlled period of the match. Subsequently, we lost phone connection with the robot in two separate matches through what now seems to be a intermittent plug connection problem at the driver control phone. <br>
<br>
Q: We would like to have the coach hold the phone during the driver-controlled period and assure the plug remains firmly attached. Is this allowed by rule G11?<br>
-------<br>
<br>
&lt;G11&gt; Drive Team Coach Interference – During the Driver-Controlled Period, Robots must be remotely operated only by the Drivers using the Team’s Driver Station and/or by software running in the on-board Robot control system. The first instance of Coach interference (e.g. touching a Gamepad) will result in a warning, with any following instances resulting in a Major Penalty and/or Disqualification. During the Driver-Controlled Period, Drive Team Coaches and/or Drivers are allowed to hold the Team’s Driver Station Android Device and interact with it to select an Op Mode, view information displayed on the screen, and initialize, start, stop, and reset the Robot.<br>

<br>
"Yesterday the beacons were crazy, they constantly went wild, even with no one of the mountains or touching the field perimeter that I saw"<br>
<br>
It was found that the AndyMark rescue beacons can malfunction due to static effects, at least on some fields/setups. If a rescue beacon malfunctions during the autonomous phase of a match, how will pressing the buttons be scored, especially if the beacon "resets" and is still randomizing when the team approaches and interacts with it?<br>
A: If a Rescue Beacon exhibits unexpected behavior during the Autonomous Period, Referees will record the Score of the Rescue Beacon based on their real time observations during the Autonomous Period. Referees do not have to wait until the end of the Autonomous Period to record the Score for Rescue Beacons that appear to malfunction. If the Referees are not able to discern the correct Score for the Rescue Beacon, the Driver-Controlled Period will not be played. Drive teams will remain at the competition Playing Field, the Playing Field will be reset, and the Match will be immediately replayed starting with the Autonomous Period.<br>
<br>
The Game Design Committee anticipates that the unexpected behavior of the Rescue Beacons will be eliminated by retrofitting Rescue Beacons with an Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) prevention upgrade developed by AndyMark. Instructions for installing the ESD prevention upgrade will be published soon. FIRST will require official tournaments to use Rescue Beacons that have been retrofitted with the ESD prevention upgrade.</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-08-2015, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a question about rule:<br>
<br>
1.5.1 Pre-Match<br>
<br>
f. Teams may pre-load up to two Climbers per Robot. The pre-loaded Climbers must be in contact<br>
with a single Robot and they may touch the Playing Field. Teams may elect not to pre-load some<br>
or all of their Climbers. Climbers that are not pre-loaded are placed by field personnel in a<br>
random location and orientation, lying flat, and Completely Inside the corresponding Alliance<br>
Floor Goal. <br>
<br>
At our first event the above rule was used to place climbers that were not used by robots on the field. At our last event this was not done. The climbers that were not used were left on the totes next to the field. We specifically redesigned our robot to pick up the unused climbers and then were not able to use many of them. We approached the lead official by using the question box and were told the above rule was changed by the Q and A forum and that the previous event did not correctly follow the rule. The lead official said he would show us where this rule was changed but never did. I searched the game rules section of the forum and did not see anything about this specific rule. Can we have some clarification of the rule. Was this rule changed from the Q and A forum? Please direct us to the post number or page number that the change is detailed on.<br>
A: Climbers that are not pre-loaded will be placed by field personnel in a random location and orientation, lying flat, and Completely Inside the corresponding Alliance Floor Goal as specified in Section 1.5.1.f of the Game Manual Part 2. The setup procedure for the pre-loaded Climbers has not been modified by posts to the Game Q&amp;A Forum.</div></div><hr>

<br>
"Robots may Score Debris into the Low Zone Goal and engage the Low Zone Zip Line Trigger from any location on the Playing Field. Robots are required to be Completely On the Mountain and the Robot’s drivetrain (e.g. wheels, tread) must only be in contact with the portions of the Mountain above the two inch tall buffer Area that is defined by white gaffers tape located at the bottom/entrance to the Mountain ramp...."<br>
<br>
Q: If you have one set of wheels on the mountain above the buffer area and one set of wheels completely off of the mountain and on the mats, can you touch the cliff pull up bar or deposit game elements in the alliance's high or mid goals without violating a rule?<br>
A: No, the scenario described in the question violates rule &lt;GS13&gt; because the Robot is both On the Mountain and On the Playing Field floor. Robots are required to be Completely On the Mountain and the Robot's entire drivetrain must only be in contact with the portions of the Mountain above the two inch tall buffer Area that is defined by white gaffers tape located at the bottom/entrance to the Mountain ramp to perform the actions described in the question.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-09-2015, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team has a sweeper mechanism consisting of zip ties on a spindle that rotates in the front of our robot.  We use it to clear debris during the autonomous period, and to purposefully move debris into the low goal during the tele-op period.  The intent of using the sweeper is that when the robot contacts debris, the debris is in contact with the sweeper for a very short moment, after which it is flung forward.  The width of the sweeper is such that there can never be more than a couple of debris items contacting it at one time.<br>
<br>
Q: If our robot goes through a large cluster of debris, and within a short time, moves more than 5 pieces of debris (while never being in contact with more than 2 or 3 pieces at one time), does this violate &lt;GS7&gt;?  <br>
<br>
The definition of possession is:<br>
Possess / Possessing – An object is considered to be in Possession by a Robot if, as the Robot moves or changes orientation (e.g. moves forward, turns, backs up, spins in place), the object remains in approximately the same position relative to the Robot. Objects in Possession of a Robot are considered to be Controlled, and they are part of the Robot. See also Control/Controlling.<br>
<br>
In our design's case, once an object is flung away, changes in our robot's orientation result in a change of position of the object relative to the robot.  While we may very quickly contact many pieces of debris, we think we even more quickly lose our possession of the objects as defined above.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your response!<br>
- Team 2887<br>
A: The question addresses only Possession of Debris; Rule &lt;GS7&gt; also includes Control of Debris. Referees will keep in mind both Possession and Control when they apply rule &lt;GS7&gt;. The actions described in the question do not violate rule &lt;GS7&gt;.<br>
<br>
Additional related information: Robots that use a fan to move Scoring Elements can Control Debris without being in contact with the Debris. If in the referee's opinion, the fan is being used to Control the blown Debris, &lt;GS7&gt; consequences should apply.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-13-2015, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At our most recent event a question arose during the autonomous period as it relates to parking in the zones.  Here is the scenario.  <br>
<br>
During autonomous, a robot makes its way to the beacon repair zone.  When it stops, none of the robots wheels are in the zone or touching the tape.  However, a portion of the robot extends into the beacon repair zone but is not touching the floor.  Our question is this: <br>
Q1: Would that be considered parked in the zone? <br>
Q2: Further, what constitutes parking in the zone? Several people at the tournament expressed different interpretations of what constitutes parking in the rescue beacon repair zone.<br>
<br>
We are just wanting to get some clarification as to how the GDC is wanting "parking in the zone" to be interpreted.<br>
A1: Yes, the Robot described in the question is Parked In the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone and it should earn five points.<br>
<br>
A2: Section 1.5.2.4 requires that a Robot must be Parked In their Alliance's Rescue Beacon Repair Zone at the end of the Autonomous period to earn five points. It is important to note that the terms "Parked" and "In" in section 1.5.2.4 have italics formatting with the first letter capitalized. Words in the Game Manual that are formatted in italics with their first letter capitalized have specific meanings in the context of the game FIRST RES-Q. In the Game Q&amp;A Forum, the special defined terms have their first letter capitalized and italics formatting is not used for simplicity. A visit to the Game Definitions section (1.4) of the Game Manual Part 2 is in order to understand the conditions that are required to earn points for Parking In the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone.<br>
<br>
The definitions of "Parked" and "In" in the context of FIRST RES-Q are:<br>
<br>
Park / Parked - A Robot that is motionless.<br>
<br>
In(side) / Completely In(side) - An object that has crossed into the vertical (i.e. at a right angle to the Playing Field tile floor) extension of a defined Area's boundary is Inside the Area. An object that is entirely within the vertical extension of a defined Area's boundary is Completely Inside the Area.<br>
<br>
The definition of "In" uses the defined term "Area." The definition of "Area" in the context of FIRST RES-Q is:<br>
<br>
Area - The space defined by the vertical projection of the outside edge of a region's boundary (e.g. gaffers tape, Goal, Playing Field Wall). The boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is considered to be part of the Area for the purposes of determining Inside and Outside.<br>
<br>
Combining the description of the Scoring achievement with the definitions of "Parked," "In," and "Area" we can determine the requirements for a Robot to be counted as Scored for Parking In the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone. "Parked," requires that the Robot must be motionless. "In," indicates that any portion of the Robot has to have crossed into the vertical extension of a defined Area's boundary. The definition of "Area," specifies that the outer edge of the gaffers tape is the starting boundary of the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone. The Game Manual didn't use the defined terms "Supported" or "On". Since the Game Manual didn't require the Robot to be "Supported" by, "On," or "Completely Inside" the Rescue Beacon Repair Zone Area, all that is required is for a Robot to extend Into the Area.<br>
<br>
Therefore, a motionless Robot with any portion Inside the outer edge of the gaffers tape boundary of the Alliance's Rescue Beacon Repair Zone at the conclusion of the Autonomous period will earn five points.</div></div><hr>

In one part of the rules it says 5 seconds and the other it says 10 seconds. How many seconds is it?<br>
A: The length of time that Robots may not enter the opposing Alliance's Area of the Playing Field during the Autonomous Period is ten seconds. See rule &lt;GS5&gt; for the complete details.

A: The Rescue Beacon unit does not have a special purpose, built-in navigation aid. Robots may use the blue and red visible light LEDs that are located inside the Rescue Beacon as a navigation aid. The Playing Field floor in front of the Rescue Beacon has a navigation aid consisting of a two foot (0.61 meters) long, one inch (0.025 meters) wide strip of white gaffers tape that leads to the centerline of the Rescue Beacon. See the FIRST RES-Q Field Setup Guide for a description of the placement of the white navigation tape.<br>
<br>
The FIRST RES-Q Playing Field does not have the IR Beacon that was used in last season's FIRST Tech Challenge game.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-16-2015, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have read the previous posts (#72) on plowing during the autonomous period http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4629-Game-Rules-Answer-Thread&amp;p=21668&amp;viewfull=1#post21668<br>
<br>
The crux of this seems to boil down the the referee determining Intent.  As we watch videos and participate in various official events, we have seen that intent is being interpreted differently and not consistently.  We're all human and that's not unexpected.  We do believe that a little further clarity and consistency would help the entire community, refs &amp; players.<br>
<br>
A most common autonomous path to deliver climbers to the shelter/beacon is:<br>
<br>
A square bumper robot drives close to and parallel to the mountain, then turns near/in the floor goal to approach the beacon.  Robots typically will be plowing more than 5 debris, and most often some are left in the scoring zone<br>
<br>
Q1 - Is this scenario considered strategic plowing and to be penalized?<br>
<br>
Q2 - If the blocks are not scored but left outside the floor goal, they would still seem to be left in a strategic position.  Either in front of the floor goal or the opponents mountain:  Would this scenario also result in a penalty?<br>
<br>
<br>
In short, there are not a lot of spots for plowed blocks to end up in between the starting wall and beacon which don't have a strategic component, thus intent.  If debris end in the beacon repair zone, they are also strategically close to the floor goal, but a direct path to the beacon zone seams generally not being penalized.<br>
A: The scenarios described in this question are allowed and no &lt;GS7&gt; penalties should be applied.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-16-2015, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our goal for autonomous is to have our robot push the button on the beacon, put the climbers in the basket, and then climb up the ramp. Our autonomous starts by clearing the front of the ramp of debris, while on its it way to the beacon. More than five pieces of debris may be unintentionally brought with us into the scoring zone while on our path to press the beacon's button. However, this debris is immediately pushed out of the scoring zone on our way to the button and basket. Considering what post #72 describes in item c ("Clearing Debris from blocking access to the Mountain; provided that the Debris is not moved to block the entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain or to Score in a Floor Goal."), would pushing the debris into the scoring zone cause us to incur a penalty, even if they are not "Scored" at the end of autonomous.<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-29-2015, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your answer to post #31 in the Game Rules Q&amp;A Forum thread states: <br>
<br>
"The intent of the Game Design Committee is to allow Robots to clear Debris from blocking access to the Mountain without incurring &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties; provided that the Debris is not moved to block the entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain or to Score in a Floor Goal."<br>
<br>
When a team is trying to enter their Mountain on their side of the field, their Mountain entrance has their floor goal immediately to one side of the entrance and the opposing Alliance's side immediately to the other side. If a large amount of debris is placed in front of this Mountain entrance by the opposing alliance, this entrance is essentially blocked as it is impossible to clear debris from blocking access to the Mountain without either moving debris into the Floor Goal or in front of the entrance Area of the opposing Alliance's side of the Mountain.<br>
<br>
In this situation, are there any legal options for clearing a Mountain entrance?  Should intentionally placing debris in front of these Mountain entrances result in a Blocking Access penalty as it essentially prevents a team from being able to enter their side of the Mountain without incurring other penalties as described in post #31?  It seems as though allowing teams to block these particular Mountain entrances, combined with the penalties described in post #31, "breaks the game" as it means there is no way to clear these blocked Mountain entrances without incurring penalties. <br>
<br>
Any advice you can provide on what is and is not allowed in this situation is appreciated.<br>
A: In the scenario described in the post, Robots may avoid &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties while clearing Debris from the entrance Area to their Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area by moving the Debris through/past the the opposing Alliance's Mountain entrance Area and depositing them where they don't block the entrance Area to the opposing Alliance's Climbing Area. In this scenario, the Robot has cleared the Debris from Blocking Access to the entrances of both the Red and Blue Alliance Mountain Climbing Areas.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-29-2015, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GS11 says "During the Driver-Controlled Period, a Robot may not make contact with an opposing Alliance Robot that is Completely In its Alliance’s Mountain Climbing Area...<br>
<br>
Climbing the Mountain and performing a pull-up In the Cliff Zone may place Robots in precarious situations. The intent of this rule is to prevent outside forces from: disrupting the stability of a Robot, preventing a Robot from placing Debris into a Mountain Goal, or interfering with a Robot that is Supported by the Pull-up Bar."<br>
<br>
It is possible for a robot to be Completely On but not Completely In the Mountain Climbing Area while placing debris in a mountain goal or attempting a pull-up (e.g., a robot could be in the low zone hooked onto the low churro with a small part of the robot extending out over the floor tiles and thus not "Completely In" the Mountain Climbing Area as defined in the Game Manual Part II).  The rule as stated says that GS11 only applies if a robot is Completely In the Climbing Area, but the "intent of this rule" section makes it sound as though the GDC may have intended for GS11 to apply to any robots that are Completely On the Mountain Climbing Area instead (as robots Completely On the mountain climbing area are in the precarious situation described, even if not Completely In the area).  <br>
<br>
For examples of robots that are Completely On but not Completely In the Mountain Climbing Area, see the following two links:<br>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD_Ic7mhVlI&amp;t=170<br>
<br>
Can you clarify if the GDC intends for GS11 to apply to robots Completely In the area (as currently written) or Completely On the area (as hinted by the "intent of this rule" statement)?  Does the GDC intend for robots in this type of position to be subject to defensive contact/collisions from opposing alliance robots, or no?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your reply.<br>
A: The intent of the Game Design Committee is for &lt;GS11&gt; protections to also apply to a Robot that is both Completely On the Mountain and is not extending into the Opposing Alliance's Climbing Area.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">12-29-2015, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Support is defined in the game manual as:<br>
<br>
Support / Supported / Completely Supported – A Robot is Supported by an object if that object is bearing at least some of the weight of the Robot. If the object is bearing all of the Robot’s weight, the Robot is Fully Supported by the object.<br>
<br>
What does it mean to be "bearing at least some of the weight"?<br>
A: "Bearing" can be replaced with "carry," "hold up," or "prop up." "Weight" is a body's relative mass or the quantity of matter contained by it, giving rise to a downward force.<br>
<br>
In the context of the game FIRST RES-Q, examples of Support (i.e. bearing at least some of the weight of an object) are:<br>
<br>
1. The Mountain Supports a Robot that is Parked On or Completely On the Mountain.<br>
2. A churro Supports a Robot that is On it.<br>
3. A Robot that is resting against the side of a churro (i.e. preventing the Robot from moving down the Mountain), is Supported by the churro.<br>
4. The Pull-up Bar Supports a Robot that is hanging from it.</div></div><hr>

Situation:<br>
Red alliance waits on high zone until end game starts.  They grapple up and hang their robot.  It swings sideways some and overhangs the blue alliance high goal.  Blue alliance grabs debris and comes up to dump them in the high goal, but by the time they get there, their mechanism can no longer access the high zone goal because the other robot is hanging in the way.   How should this be ruled?  No penalty on red?  Double Major penalty on red?  something else?<br>
A: The consequences described in rule &lt;GS9&gt; for Blocking access will be applied to Robot mechanisms and/or strategies that Block Access to Scoring in an opposing Alliance's Mountain Goal if an opposing Alliance Robot is actively attempting to place Debris into the blocked Goal.</div></div><hr>

A: Alliance partner Robots may assist each other with climbing and/or Parking On the Mountain.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">01-04-2016, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am volunteering as a FIRST FTC mentor for team 10401. In order to climb/hang from the bar in the end game the students designed a grappling hook tethered to a string and pulley acting as a winch.  They then designed a small PVC tube which gets filled with 2 pumps of air from a bicycle pump, then released through a butterfly valve to launch the grappling hook no more than 4 feet (from the bottom of the ramp to the pull up bar ).<br>
<br>
The setup is very safe - only 2 pumps of air from a bicycle pump (approx. 35 psi).  The grappling is 3D printed and very light (only a few ounces) and it is tethered to the robot by a high strength cord.<br>
<br>
I found a rule in the Game Manual Part 1, that states that "parts of the Robot itself may not be launched", but since the grappling hook is tethered to the robot and will be retracted, is this technically "launching a part of the robot"?  No where in the rules are pneumatics mentioned.  The robot is allowed to expand using stored energy, would this just be a logical extension of that?<br>
<br>
For reference: <br>
&lt;RG11&gt; Game elements launched by Robots should not have a velocity greater than that required to reach a maximum of 1.5 meters (5 feet) above the lowest point of the Robot, nor travel a horizontal distance greater than 3 meters (10 feet) from the point that the game element ends contact with the Robot. Parts of the Robot itself may not be launched.<br>
A: The Robot design described in the post is not allowed by the Robot construction rules for the following reasons:<br>
1) Pneumatic devices are not an allowed energy source in rule &lt;RG10&gt;.<br>
2) Rule &lt;RG11&gt; states that parts of the Robot may not be launched. A tethered grappling hook that has been launched from the Robot is still part of the Robot.<br>

A: In general, Robots should remain Inside the Playing Field Perimeter for safety reasons. The Game Design Committee wrote rules &lt;S2&gt; and &lt;GS20&gt; to balance safety with allowing Robots to play the game. The Game Design Committee's intent for these two rules is to avoid penalizing Robots for Inconsequential extensions Outside the Playing Field Perimeter and to allow Robots to extend outside the Playing Field Perimeter when interacting with the Game Elements listed in rule &lt;GS20&gt;.<br>

Thanks<br>
A1: Throwing, tossing, hurling, flinging, pitching, lobbing, shooting, heaving, and slinging are additional descriptors for "launching" a part of the robot. Releasing a hook from an arm when the hook is in contact with the Pull-up Bar is allowed. "Tossing" the hook is not allowed.<br>
<br>
A2: The action described in the question is not allowed. The Climber is tethered to the Robot; making the Climber "part of the Robot," even after it has been "tossed." Rule &lt;RG11&gt; prohibits parts of the Robot from being launched.<br>

When we go to hang we first extend and make contact (grappling) with the bar, slip slightly back touching the tape a little and then pulling up on the bar to hang. Would this still be a valid hang?<br>
<br>
Q2: As clarified in Q&amp;A 107 if a robot hanging is blocking a goal of the opposing alliance from scoring then it breaks rule GS9. During a match in order to score the all clear signal you must be close to the opposing scoring zone which in many cases may be close to the basket. How far on your side of the mountain do you now have to be in order to be able to hang?<br>
A1: The scenario described in the question is allowed. The Robot is Completely On the Mountain above the buffer Area when it attaches to the Cliff Pull-up Bar and the Robot remains Completely On the Mountain for the remainder pull-up maneuver. Slipping back and touching the buffer Area after grappling the Pull-up Bar is an Inconsequential action and the Robot remains eligible to earn points for a successful hang from the Cliff Pull-up Bar.<br>
<br>
A2: Robot hang question: The Blocking Access rule, &lt;GS9&gt;, consequences will be invoked when the referees believe that a Robot has a consequential affect on an opposing Alliance Robot that is actively attempting to Score Debris into the Mountain Goal. A Robot that is hanging above a portion of the Mountain Goal while an opposing Alliance Robot is attempting to Score Debris into a Mountain Goal is not an automatic violation of &lt;GS9&gt;. Referees will make the determination based on the unique circumstances of the Match.<br>
<br>
Robot triggering the All Clear Signal question: The Mountain Goals are in an Alliance-shared space between the two Climbing Areas. Ingress into this area while a Robot is in the act of triggering the All Clear Signal is allowed. Robots should not Block Access to the opposing Alliance's Mountain Goal after the All Clear Signal has been triggered. Rule &lt;GS9&gt; consequences will come into play if the Robot continues to Block Access after a reasonable amount of time has been allowed to leave the Area after triggering the All Clear Signal and the Robot has a consequential affect on an opposing Alliance Robot that is actively attempting to Score Debris into the Mountain Goal.</div></div><hr>

Our team is wondering about the specifics of GS7 and GS8. GS8 states that we are allowed to collect debris in accordance with GS7. GS8 also states that debris is worth zero in Autonomous, but will not be removed at the end of the period. If we were to get more than 5 debris (unintenionaly) into the floor goal, would they be scored at the end of the driver-controlled period?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
A: There is no rule that limits the total number of legally Scored Debris during the Autonomous Period. All Debris In the Floor Goal at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period will be counted as Scored if they were:<br>
 <br>
a) Scored legally during the Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Periods, or<br>
b) entered the Floor Goal when they are introduced onto the Playing Field.</div></div><hr>

When is fully supported required? While there is still power sent to the motors, or after the motors are powered down? If the robot descends once the program ends does this still count as being fully supported? Or, must the robot still be hanging after power is removed from the motors without descending?<br>
A: Rule &lt;G12&gt; states that referee scoresheets are filled out at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period when all objects on the Playing Field have come to rest. After a Match ends, a Robot that "descends once the program ends" will be Scored based on its state after it has come to rest.</div></div><hr>

It also states that "Robots may expand beyond the starting size constraint after the start of the Match."<br>

What is the definition of "Start of Match?" Is this:<br>

A) After Robot Placement and BEFORE the Autonomous OpMode is Selected<br>
B) After Robot Placement, OpMode Selected, and BEFORE INIT is Pressed<br>
C) After Robot Placement, OpMode Selected, and INIT Pressed, but BEFORE START Pressed?<br>
<br>
I have watched videos where robots move during the initialization process to greater than the 18x18x18. In some tournaments the robot was disqualified as interpretation C was used. In other cases the robot was neither disqualified nor penalized as either interpretation A or B was used. A and B should result in no moving items on the robot. However, C may cause robot parts to move during servo initialization.<br>
<br>
In summary, does the robot have to stay within the 18x18x18 cube during initialization (only servos moving to preset position and no motors moving)?<br>
<br>
Very respectfully,<br>
<br>
Pirates of the Pacific<br>
A: The correct answer is "C." The Robot is required to be inside the rule &lt;G3&gt; size constraint upon the conclusion of the initialization routine and before the "Start" button is pressed. Robot parts are allowed to move and they may extend outside the size constraint during Robot initialization.</div></div><hr>

<br>
It is unclear to us what procedures must be followed at the end of autonomous.  Under clarification #98 in the Game Rules answer thread, it seems that all motors must be electrically floating for the robot to have been considered to have been stopped at the end of the match.  However,<br>
<br>
Q: It is unclear if all motors must be electrically floating at the end of autonomous.  Would it be legal, after the 30 second period has ended, to apply power to the motors without causing the robot to move?<br>
<br>
This seems to stem from the fact that "stop playing the game" is not well defined in the game manuals.  It seems to us that "stop playing the game" would indicate that it is illegal to move any motors, not that all motors must electrically float.  However, clarification #98 appears to undermine this.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time,<br>
A: Motors should be unpowered during the transition time between the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods. Section 1.5.2 of the Game Manual Part 2 requires Drive Teams to use the Driver Station "Start" feature with the thirty second stop timer to start the Autonomous Period. This places the Robot in a safe condition thirty seconds later, for referees and FTAs to perform their duties during the transition time between the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods. Playing Filed Personnel will instruct Drive Teams to pick up their Driver Stations when the Playing Field is ready for the Driver-Controlled Period. At this time, Drive Teams pick up their Driver Station, select their Driver-Controlled OpMode, and press the "Init" button. Following a countdown to start the Driver-Controlled Period, Drive Teams press the "Start" button on their Driver Station.</div></div><hr>

The robot has a straight bumper that does not collect debris, but occasionally may push more than 5 pieces of debris in autonomous depending on the debris distribution.  Post #72 in this thread says:<br>
<br>
"A few examples of Robot actions that the rule (GS7) is NOT intended to prevent (i.e. the actions do not earn &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties) are...  b) Plowing through Debris to gain access to the Mountain"<br>

If, in plowing through debris to gain access to the Mountain as described above (legal?), the robot's actions end up pushing debris in front of or slightly on the entrance of the Opposing alliance's mountain area (illegal?), is the overall action legal or not?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any clarification you can provide.<br>
A: Plowing through Debris without a strategic Scoring or defensive intent for the Debris is not subject to rule &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties. Referees observing the Match will use their judgment to determine if a Robot is plowing through Debris (allowed without incurring a penalty), or if there is a strategic Scoring or defensive intent that should incur &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties. The movement of Debris described in the question appear to be an unintentional (i.e. not planned) consequence of plowing through Debris to access the Mountain that should not incur &lt;GS7&gt; Penalties.</div></div><hr>

A: Rule &lt;GS10&gt; states that Inadvertent and Inconsequential Robot ingress into the opposing Alliance's Area is allowed without incurring a Penalty at the discretion of the referees. No Penalties should be assessed because the Robot's actions described in the question were Inadvertent and they did not have a consequential effect on an opposing Alliance Robot.</div></div><hr>

<br>
We wanted to know if the GDC could explain what is the correct angle for the zip liners to be officially triggered? Since the refs will be watching the tiggers and not the climbers.<br>
<br>
We have heard from some other meets and or qulaifers of 45 degrees or greater to be deemed released? <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
A: The Game Design Committed does not approve of using a specific angle of the Trigger to determine the Scored state of Zip Line Climbers for the following reasons:<br>
 <br>
1) The Game Manual and Field Assembly and Setup Guides do not specify a calibration standard for an engaged Trigger.<br>
2) Scoring the Zip Line Climbers is performed after the end of the Driver-Controlled Period. Triggers are likely to change their angular position due to Robot interaction with the Trigger and Mountain during the remainder of the Match. <br>
<br>
Referees will follow the guidance provided in rule &lt;GS14&gt; when determining the Scored state of the Zip Line Climbers.</div></div><hr>

If we were on the red team and drove with a wheel on top of the red tape, would we be penalized? If we accidentally moved a little bit onto the blue tape, would we be penalized?<br>
A: The answer to this question is found by reviewing the definition of "Area" in the game definitions section (1.4) of the Game Manual Part 2. In the context of the game FIRST RES-Q, Area is "the space defined by the vertical projection of the outside edge of a region's boundary (e.g. gaffers tape, Goal, Playing Field Wall). The boundary element (tape, wall, markings, etc.) is considered to be part of the Area for the purposes of determine Inside and Outside." The outside edge of the Alliance Area is the line where the red and blue gaffers tape touch.<br>
<br>
Rule &lt;GS5&gt; specifies that Robots may not go Inside the opposing Alliance's Area of the Playing Field during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period. The red Alliance Robot in the question has entered the opposing Alliance Area when it "moved a little bit onto the blue tape." Guidance provided in rule &lt;GS5&gt; states that Inadvertent and Inconsequential ingress into the opposing Alliance Area will not be Penalized. The referees observing the match will make the determination if the incursion is Inadvertent and Inconsequential.<br>
<br>
A red Alliance Robot that "moves a little bit onto the blue tape" and does not contact a Robot on the opposing Alliance is likely to be viewed by the referees as Inadvertent and Inconsequential.</div></div><hr>

<br>
"Inadvertent and Inconsequential contact made with the All Clear Signal, the Pull-up Bar, or the Cliff Low Bar will not result in a Penalty of loss of Score."<br>
<br>
Please provide guidance for 2 scenarios:<br>
<br>
Q1: Before the end game occurs we begin to deploy a mechanism that we will use to pull us up the mountain so we are in a better position to grab onto the pull up bar during the end game. While we are deploying this mechanism we come in contact with the cliff low bar before we grab onto the high zone churro to pull us up. Would this be considered inadvertent and inconsequential since the contact made was in an effort to get ready to score during end game?<br>
<br>
Q2: Before the end game occurs we begin to deploy a mechanism that we will use to grab onto the pull up bar and complete the pull up. While we are lining up our mechanism we come in contact with the cliff low bar or the pull up bar. Would this be considered inadvertent and inconsequential since the contact made was in an effort to get ready to score during the end game?<br>
A1: Referees observing the Robot's actions will make the determination if the contact is Inadvertent and Inconsequential. It is reasonable to assume that occasional contact with the Cliff Low Bar is likely to be viewed as an Inadvertent and Inconsequential action if it the contact is not a strategy to help with Scoring Debris or preparing for the End Game achievements.<br>
<br>
A2: The action described is not Inadvertent or Inconsequential because it is a strategy where the Robot gains an advantage by its early preparation for the End Game achievements. Rule &lt;GS18&gt; Penalties should apply in this situation.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A GS5 question:  During our last event our robot was driving towards the rescue beacon, and got caught up on some debris causing our robot to drive temporarily across into the opposing alliance area of the playing field, crossing the gaffers tape and over into their area about 10 inches.  The robot then drove back across to our alliance area.<br>
<br>
None of the opposing alliance robots moved from the start position.  No contact with any elements (other than debris) on the opposing alliance area was made by the offending robot.<br>
<br>
Q: Based upon the above scenario where a robot crosses over into the opposing alliance area during the first 10 seconds of autonomous, and then crosses back without making contact with the opposing alliance robot, would this be considered "Inadvertent and Inconsequential"?<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your time.<br>
A: The Robot actions described in the question are Inadvertent because entering the opposing Alliance area was not a planned strategy. The actions are also Inconsequential because no contact was made with an opposing Alliance Robot and the Robot did not achieve a strategic advantage. &lt;GS5&gt; Penalties should not apply in this scenario.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">02-02-2016, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We attended a qualifier this weekend where two different opinions existed regarding the pre match initialization routine before the autonomous run starts. One view was that an initialization routine had to be run even if  the robot was not going to run during the autonomous period.  The other view was that if the robot did not intend to move during the autonomous period, the initialization routine did not have to run. <br>
<br>
The rule that was being discussed was in section 1.5.1 in Game Manual 2.  It says "After placing their Robot on the Playing Field, the Drive Team pre-loads the Climbers, selects their Autonomous Period Operational Mode (Op Mode) on their Driver Station Android device and initializes their Robot by triggering the Team’s initialization event software. Drive Teams wait Completely Inside their assigned Alliance Station for the start of the Match with their Driver Station in a hands off location."<br>
<br>
Any guidance on this as we have autonomous code but under certain circumstances where our autonomous may conflict with our partner we may choose to not run. If that is the case do we need an initialize routine to meet the rule or is this only the case if running an autonomous run?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
A: Drive Teams do not have to trigger the Robot's initialization event software if the Robot is not going to move during the Autonomous Period and an initialization routine is not required for the the Robot to remain entirely inside the 18-inch cube starting constraint.</div></div><hr>

A: A Robot that is in contact with anything other than the Mountain is not Completely On the Mountain and therefore is not eligible to Score in the Mid-Zone Goal based on rule &lt;GS13&gt;.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">02-07-2016, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the manual does mention that the end game is part of the driver controlled period, the scoring summary (1.7 in game manual part 2) makes it confusing and eludes to being able to accumulate both points. Just need to clarify. For example, If you are parked on the high zone (at the end of the driver controlled period and before the start of the end game) and then you were hanging at the end of the end game, would you have 120pts (40 for high zone park during the driver controlled period + 80pts for hanging during the end game) or would you just have the 80pts? <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
A: First of all, the statement: "at the end of the driver controlled period and before the start of the end game," is not valid. The End Game portion of the Match is the final thirty seconds of the two-minute-long Driver-Controlled Period (i.e. the End Game is a period of time that occurs during the Driver-Controlled Period). The Match ends at the conclusion of the Driver-Controlled Period.<br>
<br>
Section 1.5.3.4 in the Game Manual Part 2 states that Robots earn points based on where they are Parked On the Mountain at the end of the Driver-Controlled Period (i.e. at the end of the Match). The locations of the Robot prior to the end of the Driver-Controlled Period do not earn points that contribute to the Alliance's Match Score. The Robot described in the scenario should earn eighty points for a successful Cliff Bar Pull-up. No points are awarded for Parking on the Mountain prior to performing the Pull-up achievement.</div></div><hr>

<br>
FTC 7104 ~ The Synergists<br>
A: Both posts are correct. Post #88 in the Robot Inspection and Build Mechanical Thread addresses a Robot that has a grappling hook attached to an arm. The robot swings its arm with the the attached hook to engage the Pull-up Bar; an action that is allowed.<br>
<br>

However, we were wondering if it is legal to slightly hang over the edge of the diagonal line (such as when lining up with it), during the first 10 seconds of autonomous. This would result in a very slight entrance to the other side, but the entire drive train would remain on our side of the field, and the breach would only be very brief (for a couple of seconds). This would not affect the opponent's autonomous program. Thank you for the clarification!<br>
A: If the Robot crosses the boundary of the opposing Alliance's gaffers tape, the Robot actions violate rule &lt;GS5&gt; for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. The actions are not Inadvertent because they are part of a planned strategy.<br>
<br>
2. The Robot gains a navigation accuracy advantage that is not Inconsequential.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">02-15-2016, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We competed in a tournament this weekend and ran into a scenario that based on the interpretation of the rules resulted in zero points being awarded for an attempted hang from the pull-up bar. I do understand the strict interpretation of the rules but it seems to be a technicality versus a purposeful "penalty" that would help to clarify so that others don't run into this problem at higher levels of competition.<br>
<br>
Our team robot uses a tape measure to hang from the top bar and also has RC mud tires that are soft for climbing. The robot also has an arm that swings over the top of the pull up bar to lock in the robot. Depending on the dynamics of the hang the robot will have two tires above the cliff low bar either touching. To determine if the robot is resting on the cliff low bar the refs would push it away from the cliff bar and if it moved freely then it was hanging and would get 80 points. If it appeared to be resting on the cliff low bar because pushing it with a stick didn't move it then the team was awarded zero points for the hang/climb. In every circumstance of the hang the robot is fully supported by the tape measure which is geared so that it doesn't extend based on weight of robot plus an arm that is then moved over the top of the pull up bar for a second point of contact. <br>
<br>
Based on the rule listed below the expectation is that you can rest against the Cliff Low Bar and if removed the robot would continue to hang from the pull up bar. Based on the physics "Robot Fully Supported" and being allowed to rest against the Cliff Low Bar the Cliff Low Bar will support some portion of the robot. <br>
<br>
From the Game Manual Part II<br>
<br>
Cliff Pull-up Bar – A Robot Fully Supported (i.e. hanging) by the Cliff Pull-up Bar earns eighty points for its Alliance. Robots may touch the Cliff Vertical Divider, rest against the Cliff Low Bar, and be in contact with an opposing Alliance Robot if the contact is Inadvertent and Inconsequential. The intent of this Scoring achievement is for the Cliff Pull-up Bar to support the Robot’s weight. If the Cliff Vertical Divider, Cliff Low Bar and the opposing Alliance Robot are removed from the Mountain, a Robot that is Fully Supported by the Cliff Pull-up Bar would not fall from the Cliff.<br>
<br>
Could you clarify the following scenarios:<br>
<br>
Q1: If a robot is hanging from the pull up bar and not touching a high zone churro or any other portion of the high zone is the intent of the rules to award zero points because by chance some portion of the robot is stuck on the cliff low bar. If the robot is resting on the cliff low bar and the bar is removed, the robot would "fall" and come to rest on some portion of the high zone; our expectation is that the team would get points for reaching the high zone.<br>
<br>
Q2: In a similar scenario to Q1, if the robot has some portion of the robot touching the high zone basket and the basket is clearly not providing support how would the hang from the pull up bar be scored where it was determined the robot was "resting" on the cliff low bar. <br>
<br>
Q3: Same scenario as Q2, except the robot is not resting on the cliff low bar.<br>
<br>
Q4: If hanging from pull up bar, not resting on the cliff low bar but touching some portion of the high zone basket what would be the point earned.<br>
<br>
Q5: If a robot is hanging from the pull up bar and in non-supportive contact with the the cliff low bar. If the cliff low bar is removed and it is obvious that the robot would rotate and have some portion of the robot touching the high zone what would be the points earned.<br>
<br>
Q6: Same scenario as Q5, except the cliff low bar is supporting the robot.<br>
First of all, the procedure described in the post that was used to determine if the Cliff Low Bar is providing Support to the Robot is valid. A Robot that easily "swings" away from the Cliff Low Bar is not receiving Support from the Cliff Low Bar in the context of the game FIRST RES-Q. If the Robot does not easily "swing" away from the Cliff Low Bar or if the Robot lowers when it does swing away from the Cliff Low Bar, the bar is Supporting a portion of the Robot's weight.<br>
<br>
Please review the following posts to the Game Q&amp;A Forum for additional guidance for determining a valid Pull-up:  27, 61, 65, 70, 73, 76, 77, 84, and 101. <br>
<br>
A portion of the answer in post #65 is worth highlighting in this post: "Robots using the Cliff Low Bar as a "step" for support after the Match ends should not earn Pull-up Score points. Robots resting against the Cliff Low Bar like a person would lean against a wall is allowed for a successful Pull-up Score."<br>
<br>
A1: Yes, the intent of the game rules is to award zero points for a Pull-up if the Cliff Low Bar is Supporting the Robot.<br>
<br>
In this scenario, if removing the Cliff Low Bar results in the Robot "falling and resting on some portion of the High Zone" it does not qualify the Robot for Parking in the High Zone.<br>
<br>
If the Robot is partially Supported by the Pull-up Bar it remains eligible for earning points for Parking in the High Zone if the Robot is also Supported by the Mountain High Zone and the Robot is not supported by the zones below the High Zone or the Playing Field floor.<br>
<br>
A2: Zero points for a Pull-up because the Robot is Supported by the Cliff Low Bar and zero points for Parking in the High Zone because the Robot is not Supported by the High Zone.<br>
<br>
A3: Eighty points for a successful Pull-up because the Robot is not Supported by the Cliff Low Bar or any other portion of the Mountain located in the lower zones.<br>
<br>
A4: Eighty points for a successful Pull-up if the High Zone Goal is not Supporting the Robot or forty points for a successful Park in the High Zone if the High Zone Goal is Supporting the Robot.<br>
<br>
A5: Eighty points for a successful Pull-up because the Robot is Fully Supported by the Pull-Up Bar and it is not Supported by another portion of the Mountain.<br>
<br>
A6: Zero points for a Pull-up because the Robot is Supported by the Cliff Low Bar and zero points for Parking in the High Zone because the Robot is not Supported by the High Zone.</div></div><hr>

It seems that plowing is allowed, but would dragging also be allowed?<br>
A: This activity is comparable to the allowed action of clearing Debris from the Playing Field floor in front of the Mountain entrance. Robots may clear Debris from their Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area without incurring &lt;GS7&gt; penalties; provided that the Debris above the five count limit are not moved for a defensive or Debris Scoring purpose.  A few examples of Intentional actions that are considered to be strategic defensive or Scoring actions that violate rule &lt;GS7&gt; if more than five Debris are Possessed or Controlled by a Robot are:<br>
<br>
1. Moving Debris to block the entrance of the opposing Alliance's Climbing Area.<br>
2. Moving Debris onto the opposing Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area.<br>
3. Scoring Debris into a Goal.<br>
<br>
Movement of Debris can be unpredictable. If Debris is moved into an Area that may provide a strategic advantage, Referees that are watching the Match will determine if the movement of the additional Debris was a purposeful strategy to gain a Scoring or defensive advantage that is a violation of rule &lt;GS7&gt;, or an Inadvertent result of clearing Debris from the Mountain that is not a violation of &lt;GS7&gt;.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">02-18-2016, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.  We are looking for some guidance on the 1.5.4 rule for the all clear signal. As you know the rule for scoring says the the corresponding Alliance color baton is rotated upward into an approximate vertical orientation. We are looking at a scenario where our lift arm is between the lift arm and the baton which gives a ~1 - 1.5 inch gap at the top of the baton based on the angle of the baton sitting on our lift arm.  This certainly makes it "approximately vertical" as it is between 70-80 degrees and definitely turned toward our side, but is that enough for an "approximately vertical orientation" or is it solely based on the ruling at the match?  We haven't run into this yet and in looking at the postings I could find further guidance on this so we wanted to post the question.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
A: There is no absolute measure that defines Approximately Vertical. By definition, the word approximate in the scoring position includes a range of acceptable scoring positions for the All Clear Signal. If in the opinion of the referees at the field, the All Clear Signal is approximately vertical, it should be counted as scored.<br>
<br>
The scenario described in the question appears to satisfy the approximately vertical requirement for the All Clear Flag. Referees observing the Match will make the final decision.</div></div><hr>

Our team (#8720 Eagles) uses custom 3D printed "paddles" to grip the churros on the mountain while climbing. These "paddles" stop our robot from slipping, and help us easily climb the mountain. However, at previous tournaments, there has been a lot of talk about whether our robot is hanging or not on the mountain in certain positions. We would like to clarify which positions our robot can be in to clarify as hanging. <br>
<br>
Follow the link below to access 5 exhibits (with a picture and description) of our robot hanging. In each one, the paddles are in a different position (not touching (control), a little bit touching on the top, a little bit touching on the bottom, completely touching the top, and completely touching on the bottom). We would be extremely grateful if you could inform us of which exhibits count as hanging, and which ones don't. Thank you so much for your time and effort!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Team 8720<br>

A: If the Cliff Low Bar provides support like a "step" to any part of the Robot, including the "paddles" described in the question, it is not a successful Pull-up. A Robot leaning against the Cliff Low Bar like a person leans against a wall remains eligible to earn points for a Pull-up. Robots parts that touch the underneath side of the Cliff Low Bar remain eligible to earn points for a Pull-up.<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">03-15-2016, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have two questions, as we have sometimes observed these scenarios when several robots are bunched together during a match.<br>
<br>
Q1: Consider the following situation. A robot is positioned between an opposing robot and a mountain of the opposite color (e.g. Red team robot between a Blue team robot and a Blue mountain), so that the opposing robot would be unable to access the mountain if an attempt was made. The two robots are fairly close together. This persists for well over five seconds. When the (Red) robot eventually moves away from the (Blue) mountain, the opposing (Blue) robot does not immediately attempt to access the (Blue) mountain but instead performs some other task (e.g. gathers debris for several seconds) before attempting to access the (Blue) mountain. How does rule GS9 apply? If the opposing (Blue) robot does not actively attempt to access the (Blue) mountain soon after access becomes possible, was the (Red) robot blocking access per GS9?<br>
<br>
Q2: Consider another situation. A robot is in front of a mountain of the opposite color (e.g. Red team robot in front of a Blue mountain). Two robots from the opposing (Blue) alliance are positioned so that the (Red) robot is unable to move away from the front of the (Blue) mountain. How do rules G16 and GS9 apply? Does pinning or trapping apply to the space in front of the (Blue) mountain, and can a (Red) robot be penalized for blocking access per GS9 if it is trapped by two opposing (Blue) robots per G16?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

A1: The scenario described in the question does not violate rule &lt;GS9&gt; because the Blue Alliance Robot is not actively attempting to access its Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area. <br>
<br>
A2: Rule &lt;GS9&gt; applies if one or more of the Blue Alliance Robots are actively attempting to access their Mountain Climbing Area. The Blue Alliance Robot(s) need to provide an obvious indication of their intent to access the Mountain before the &lt;GS9&gt; consequences come into play. For example, in the scenario described in the question, a Blue Alliance Robot moving towards their Alliance's Mountain Climbing Area and making contact with the Red Alliance Robot is a good indication of intent to access the Mountain. Since the Red Alliance Robot described in the scenario does not have an open path to leave the entrance to the Mountain Climbing Area, one or more Robots on the Blue Alliance must give the Red Alliance Robot a reasonable opportunity to escape the area after the Blue Alliance has made it clear that they want to access their Alliance's Climbing Area before &lt;GS9&gt; penalties are applied. If the Blue Alliance Robots do not allow the Red Alliance Robot to escape, the Trapping rule comes into play and &lt;GS9&gt; consequences are not applied because of rule &lt;G17&gt; protections.<br>
<br>
The Pinning or Trapping Rule, &lt;G16&gt;, comes into play if the Red Alliance Robot in the example provides an obvious indication of their intent to leave the area in front of the Blue Alliance Mountain Climbing Area and the Blue Alliance Robots continue to Block all exit paths for the Red Alliance Robot.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A: No, this is not a violation of rule &lt;GS10&gt;.<br>
<br>
Game Design Committee Warning: Intentionally depositing Debris into an opposing Alliance Mountain Climbing Area is considered to be a strategy that Blocks Access and violates rule &lt;GS9&gt;. Inadvertently depositing Debris into an opposing Alliance Mountain Climbing Area during the act of Scoring into a Mountain Goal is allowed.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Q1: If a red-alliance robot tries to put 2 cubes into a high goal that already contains 14 cubes, and those 2 cubes spill onto the blue ramp, is that 2 40-point penalties?<br>
Q2: If a red-alliance robot tries to put 5 cubes into a high goal that already contains 10 cubes (just to make sure that the goal can be "topped off" with cubes), and one spills onto the blue ramp, is that a 40-point penalty?<br>
Q3: If a red-alliance robot tries to put 5 cubes into a high goal that already contains 9 cubes, and 2 spill onto the blue ramp, is that 2 40-point penalties?<br>
First of all, the penalties cited in the questions are not consistent with the consequence for violating rule &lt;GS9&gt;. The penalty for violating rule &lt;GS9&gt; is a Major Penalty plus an additional Major Penalty for every five seconds that the condition persists. Also keep in mind that &lt;GS9&gt; Penalties are assessed only if a Robot on the opposing Alliance is actively attempting to access or escape the affected Area. If rule &lt;GS9&gt; comes into play for depositing Debris into the opposing Alliance's Climbing Area, the Penalty is not per Debris. Placing two pieces of Debris receives the same Penalty as placing a single piece of Debris in the opposing Alliance's Climbing Area.<br>
<br>
A1, A2 &amp; A3: The Robot's actions described in all three questions do not violate any rules. No penalty should be assessed.<br>
<br>
If a &lt;GS9&gt; warning has not been issued by a referee, Robot actions that attempt to place Debris into a Mountain Goal should not receive &lt;GS9&gt; Penalties; even if the Mountain Goal already contains nine, ten, fourteen, or more pieces of Debris.<br>
<br>
During a Match, it is difficult for Referees and Drive Teams to determine with certainty if a Mountain Goal has the capacity to hold more Debris. Robots should be allowed attempts to place additional Debris into a Mountain Goal without incurring &lt;GS9&gt; Penalties, until a Robot has demonstrated that it is unlikely that a Mountain Goal is capable of holding additional Debris (i.e. most of the Debris spill onto the Mountain and not into the Goal). If a Robot tries to place Debris into a Mountain Goal and most of the Debris spill onto the opposing Alliance's Climbing Area because the Goal is at capacity, Referees will issue a warning. After a referee's warning, further attempts to place Debris into the full goal may receive Penalties for violating rule &lt;GS9&gt;.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solar Flare</div><div class="date">04-07-2016, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our robot sometimes touches the side of the Mountain High Zone Goal during our final hang.  According to responses #73 and #137, we are completing a successful Pull-up when this is the case.  However, when we pointed this out, we were told that there was a referee forum that had discussed this matter, and the decision was made there that since we were touching a side of the Mountain High Zone Goal that was below the plane running perpendicular to the mountain surface and through the top churro, we were touching something in the high zone, and therefore our robot was in the high zone, not the cliff zone.   <br>
<br>
Q1:  Please clarify if non-supportive contact with the side of the Mountain High Zone Goal, even if it is below the plane perpendicular to the Mountain panel and through the top churro, is allowed during a successful Pull-up.  <br>
<br>
Q2:  Does the “referee forum” take precedence over this Game Forum?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
A1: Yes, non-supportive contact with any part of the side of the Mountain High Zone Goal is allowed for a successful Pull-up, even if the contact is with a part of the Goal that is Inside the High Zone. See posts #73 and #137 for additional guidance. <br>
<br>
A2: The private referee and public team forums have equal standing. The members of the Game Design Committee that answer questions posted to the referee and team forums coordinate their answers so that there should be no conflicts between the forums. If tournament officials at an active event believe that there is a conflict between forum posts, they are encouraged to contact the on call FIRST representative to receive an official ruling.<br>
<br>
We reviewed the relevant forum posts and both forums state that non-supportive contact with the side of the Mountain High Zone Goal is allowed for a successful Pull-up<br>
<br>
There are a lot of rules and forum posts for for teams and referees to remember. Applying the game rules and guidance from the forums can be difficult for some complex match scenarios. I suspect that in this case, the confusion was caused by using the rules and forum guidance that apply to Parking in the High Zone and extending them to also apply to a successful Pull-up.</div></div><hr>
