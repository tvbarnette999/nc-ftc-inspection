<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leonard Nimoy</div><div class="date">11-07-2016, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, <br />
<br />
We have attended several trainings where we were told to do either digital or handwritten notebooks.  We wanted to know if there is more weight given to one or the other?  And what is the consideration for a notebook that has both handwritten and digital?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Answer:  As outlined in the Engineering Notebook Guidelines (http://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/engineering-notebook-guidelines.pdf) (as well as in Game Manual part 1), &quot;There is no distinction made between handwritten and electronic Engineering Notebooks during judging; each format is<br />
equally acceptable.&quot; I think your second question is asking if it is okay to have text and similar aspects of your engineering notebook that are done online, then printed, and inserted into your notebook. Yes, this is okay. At your event, the team needs to have a consolidated notebook that has the required sections present  (see page 10 of Guidelines). In all cases, the digital or online aspects need to be printed out and included directly in the notebook that is presented to the judges. Depending on how the handwritten notebook is done, it may be difficult to insert the content that is done digitally in an order that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howard</div><div class="date">12-13-2016, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team is looking for clarification on requirements for the summary page. The summary page is supposed to have important pages for the judges to consider on it. The game manual states that we should tab 6-8 pages of the Engineering Section to support the summary page. Our question is if we can include other pages on the summary page as long as we don't tab them. For example, if we want to include a major outreach event can we still list it under important pages as long as we don't tab it? The entry wouldn't be in the Engineering Section so should we leave it off the summary page?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the question.  <br />
<br />
Answer:<br />
<br />
Per the Game Manual Part 1, 7.3.4<br />
Attach a summary page to the front cover of the Engineering Notebook. The summary should be a brief, one-page narrative about the Team, the school or organization, and an overview of the highlights of the Team’s season. The Team summary page should also include the Team number and point the Judges to pages in the Engineering Notebook that the Team would most like the Judges to consider.<br />
and section 7.5.2<br />
Strongly suggested criteria for the Think Award: Teams should tab/flag 6 to 8 pages of the Engineering Section to support entries on the summary page.<br />
<br />
With that we can answer your questions:<br />
<br />
Can include other pages on the summary page as long as we don't tab them: Yes, though keep in mind the summary sheet should be brief and be easy to navigate<br />
<br />
If we want to include a major outreach event can we still list it under important pages as long as we don't tab it?: Yes, and you can even tab it.  Engineering section should have tabs, but tabs are not limited to the Engineering section. However, be careful not to overdo it!<br />
<br />
The entry wouldn't be in the Engineering Section so should we leave it off the summary page: Summary page should include highlights of the team's season, including, but not limited to work documented in the Engineering section</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds like you are assuming that the Summary Page narrative is only about the Engineering Section and/or that only the Engineering Section should have tabbed pages.  Neither of these are what is intended.   <br />
<br />
The summary one pager should be a well rounded view of your team that differentiates your team from other teams and could include Technical/Engineering aspects and Team/Outreach/Business aspects. To answer your specific question, yes, your summary can include pages beyond the Engineering Section.   <br />
<br />
There is not a magic top number of items to include in your summary highlights and/or a top number of tabbed/flagged pages that must be done. However, recognize that Judges are looking for your team to have condensed your team's unique aspects down to a manageable one page overview as well as to a manageable set of pages to look at via being tabbed/flagged.  <br />
<br />
Specifically for the Think Award,  it is strongly suggested to have tabbed/flagged 6 to 8 pages of the Engineering Section.  Note that the Judges for the other awards will be also referencing your notebook, so specific tabs/flags to guide the Judges for those awards is to your benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would recommend looking at the posted examples and resources at http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/team-management-resources</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howard</div><div class="date">02-08-2017, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a rule that states that a team may not submit more than 2 Engineering Notebooks. If a team submits 3 Engineering notebooks, are they removed from consideration for all awards? Or, because the 2 Engineering Notebook rule is part of the guidelines to qualify for the Think Award, is the team still eligible for all other awards, excluding the Think Award?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the question!<br />
<br />
Answer: Section 7.3.4 lists the minimum set of features required in order for Judges to quickly find the information they need to make Award decisions.  Since the Engineering Notebook is the &quot;voice of the Team&quot; when the Team isn't in the room, a poorly organized, or even overwhelmingly large Engineering Notebook will make is less likely a Judge will hear (or in this case read) the information a Team wants them to know.  As such, Teams should follow the requirements in 7.3.4 to be a strong contender for consideration for all Awards (except the video awards and the Judge's award).  <br />
<br />
Can a Team win an Award (e.g. Design) if they don't include a Summary Page?  Perhaps, but I wouldn't risk it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Administrator</div><div class="date">09-22-2016, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answers to questions posted pertaining to the Judges Interview.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howard</div><div class="date">12-12-2016, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were wondering if it's required to have the entire team in the interview room/counts against you if you do not have the entire team. We have a rather large team, so would there be harm in having designated presenters and only having them go in? Particularly if things like the Motivate Award say &quot;all Team members participate in their presentation.&quot; We would still have most team members present.<br />
<br />
<br />
Answer:  Taking a look at the Game Manual Part 1...<br />
<br />
4.6.3: Each Team should have at least two student Team representatives and the Robot available; the entire Team is encouraged to participate.<br />
7.4.1: No awards will be determined on the basis of this interview alone.<br />
7.5.6 Motivate Award: This Team embraces the culture of FIRST and clearly demonstrates what it means to be a Team.  Required criteria includes Team can articulate the individual contributions of each Team member, and how these attribute to the overall success of the Team.  Strongly suggested criteria includes All Team members participate in their presentation, and actively engage with the judges.<br />
<br />
So with that we can answer your questions...<br />
<br />
1) Is it required to have the entire team in the interview: No<br />
2) Does it count against you if you do not have the entire team: It is not required, but suggested.  <br />
<br />
Judges will want to see how your team functions and communicates as a whole.  The more opportunities Judges have to see your team in action (including the interview), the more information they will have when making their decisions.  There are many reasons why team members may be absent from the interview.  Perhaps they are sick, or could not make the event.  Maybe there is something critical that needs to be happening in the pit (because, nothing goes wrong in the last minute... right?).  Or maybe you have a massive team, and the logistics of squeezing everyone in the interview room has an overall effect of lowering the quality of the information you give to the judges.  This will need to be something that your team decides.  Keep in mind though, if you do leave team members out of the interview, judges may want to know why!<br />
<br />
Finally I'll leave this answer with a question.  Is there a way team members participate in the interview but not be physically in the room?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howard</div><div class="date">12-28-2016, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is can a team still be nominated for the Inspire award if the team wins the control award at the same event?<br />
<br />
There are actually two questions here.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Can a Team be nominated for multiple Awards<br />
Answer:  Yes, during Judge deliberation Teams may be nominated (by Judges) for multiple Awards.  <br />
<br />
Question 2: Can a Team win multiple Awards<br />
Answer: At a given event, a Team may win only one of the Judged Awards: Inspire, Think, Innovate, Design, Connect, Motivate, Control, and Judge's Award (if offered).  Finalists of awards (including Inspire 2nd place and Inspire 3rd place) do not count as an Award winner.  The video Awards (Compass and Promote) are judged separately and Teams may win one or both video Awards in addition to one of the Judged Awards.  <br />
<br />
So with that let's revisit the original question.<br />
<br />
Question 0: Can a team still be nominated for the Inspire Award if the team wins the Control Award at the same event?<br />
Answer: Yes, but if a Team wins Control, they can not also win Inspire.  However they could win Control and also be recognized as an Inspire Finalist (2nd or 3rd place).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Howard</div><div class="date">02-08-2017, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With regard to Post #3 in the Judging Interview Thread, what would happen if you are the only team to submit a Control Award entry at a given competition.  Since you would be the only eligible team at the competition, I would assume you would win the Control Award; however, would you then be ineligible for the Inspire Award?<br />
<br />
Excellent question!<br />
<br />
Answer: Teams should not be concerned that applying for Control in any way decreases their likelihood for consideration for Inspire.<br />
<br />
First, If only one Team submits a Control Award, do they automatically win that Award?  No, not automatically.  In order for a Team to win an Award they must meet all of the Requirements of that Award.  If no Team meets all of the requirements, then the Award may not be given at an Event.  Submitting for the Control Award only satisfies one of the Requirements.<br />
<br />
Second, I think a different way to ask the question is &quot;Will a Team disqualify themselves from Inspire if they happen to be the only Team that meets the requirements for another award?&quot;  No, Judges make determinations based on for which Award the Team is strongest.   If the Judges feel the Team should be the Inspire winner, then they would be recognized as the Inspire winner.  If, as a result, the pool of possible winners of another Award drops to zero, then that Award would not be presented.  <br />
<br />
For example.  Say Teams X and Y are the only contenders for the Control Award, but X is stronger in Think and Y is stronger in Inspire.  Then X would be recognized for Think, Y would be recognized for Inspire, and Control Award would not be presented as there are no eligible teams.</div></div><hr />
