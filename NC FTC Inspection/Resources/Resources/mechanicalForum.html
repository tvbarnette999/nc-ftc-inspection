<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">09-22-2016, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Section 5.3.1 of the Game Manual Part 1 asks teams to reflect on their Robot's design and the question: “If everybody did this, would the game play be impossible? If the answer to the question is yes, the design component is probably not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
VELOCITY VORTEX is played with Particles that are Scored in goals and recycled back to the Playing Field for continuous game play. The Game Design Committee's intent is for open recycling, where Scored Particles return to random locations on the Playing Field Floor so that both Robots on an Alliance have an equal opportunity to access, Control, or Possess their Alliance's Scored Particles. A closed recycling game strategy that denies a reasonable opportunity for an Alliance Partner Robot to access, Control, or Possess a Scored Particle is not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge and is not allowed. Game play with closed recycling of Particles would be impossible and unfair to Alliance Partners. Therefore, Robot designs and/or game strategies that deny their Alliance Partner equal access to Scored Particles, is considered to be a violation of rule &lt;GS2&gt;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">09-30-2016, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
My team has been very keen on using the camera on the phone for addressing the beacons. However, we have found that using the rear camera is a lot more reliable than the front facing one. So we were wondering if it would be possible to make a case that could flip open easily by releasing a quick clip, revealing the screen. Would this pass rule &lt;RG03&gt; because it is visible, easily accessible and  protects the phone. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Team 4042<br />
<br />
A:   The Android device screen needs to be accessible and visible at all times. If there is a cover over the screen, it needs to be transparent and easy to open. Phones that are buried in the bot or difficult to access could result in the inability of FTAs to resolve on-field issues without delaying the start of the match.<br />
<br />
Tip from the Game Design Committee: Field Technical Advisors that are not familiar with your Robot may need quick access to the Robot Controller Android device touch screen display to perform Robot triage when there is a very limited amount of time for repairing Robots before the start of the Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Periods. Covers that open by quick and intuitive actions will save the Field Technical Advisor time that (s)he can devote to solving the problem before time runs out.</div></div><hr />

Are other teams allowed to put Vision Targets on their robots?<br />
<br />
A: No, teams are not allowed to place Vision Targets on their robots.  It is against the spirit of the game for teams to interfere with the sensors of other robots.</div></div><hr />

Answer: Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">11-16-2016, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  We're looking for some clarification of Rule RG03 for the Robot Controller phone location and position. In attempting to use Vuforia, it would be most ideal to use the significantly higher resolution REAR facing camera and have this mounted low and in the &quot;middle-front&quot; of the robot. Unfortunately (as we found at a tournament over the weekend), this seems to be in conflict with <br />
<br />
<br />
In considering the desire to use Vuforia to its intended full potential, can you address the following (or adjust as needed to convey a proper reply)<br />
1. Can the phone be considered accessible if there were a rubber band that let it flip around or tip outward easily by the ref?<br />
2. Can the phone be considered accessible if there were a lever that let the phone flip around or tip outward by the ref?<br />
3. Can there be a mirror mounted to reflect the screen for the ref, although touching the screen would still be hindered and the image would be reversed?<br />
4. Provide a suggested mounting method that would satisfy &lt;RG03&gt; and permit the use of the rear camera.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  FTC 10138<br />
<br />
A1: No<br />
A2: No<br />
A3: No<br />
A4: Mounting locations are dependent on the robot design so it is impossible to suggest a mounting position.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-07-2016, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team had a question about the use of wedge top tread on our robot. &lt;RG01&gt; states that materials which could damage playing field components (such as high grip tread) are banned from use on the playing field, but my team does not intend to use wedge top tread to drive our robot. Instead, we want to use it to power our button pusher by having a wheel drive along a piece of wedge top tread. It works basically as a substitute for rack and pinion. <br />
<br />
My question is this: since our wedge top tread is never at any point making direct contact with the field or any of its components, can we still use it on our robot even though it is technically outlawed in the game manual? Thank you!<br />
<br />
A: High grip tread (including wedgetop) may not be used in contact where it can damage the field (tiles, ramp, base, etc).  All other uses are allowed including as a pad to push the bacon button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-07-2016, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully I'm posting in the right place! We would like to use the following tread and would like to know if it is acceptable:<br />
<br />
Blue Nitrile Roughtop Tread, 1&quot; Wide, Thickness 0.28, Coefficient of Friction on tight pile: 1.19, Tread material: Carbox Nitrile Rubber, Tread Pattern: Roughtop.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Steve Morales<br />
<br />
FTC Team #6085<br />
<br />
A: The GDC has not tested all possible tread and tire combinations and therefore cannot answer this specific question.  During Mechanical Inspection team may be asked to demonstrate that their choice of tread will not damage the tile floor during a match when (if) the bot is pushing hard against a wall or another bot and spinning it's wheels.  The test will be to place the robot against an immovable surface (wall) and run the wheels at full power for 15 seconds.  If there is any physical damage to the floor tile then the wheels/tread will not be allowed. Discoloration or black marks alone are not considered field damage.  Remember, the test must be made with the robot at the weight the bot will be at during a match since this will affect the degree of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">12-08-2016, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
Since only the motors listed in rule &lt;RE09&gt; are allowed, it's important to me that we can show that our motors are &quot;legal&quot; at inspection time.<br />
<br />
I'm having issues with the part numbers for the Modern Robotics (MATRIX) motors.<br />
<br />
RE09 lists the following MATRIX motors as legal:  MATRIX: 50-0012, 50-0013, 50-0014, 50-0073<br />
<br />
However, on the Modern Robotics website, the individual &quot;FTC Legal&quot; 6mm shaft motor is listed as SKU: 50-0120, and the part number designation on the motor itself is 14-0020<br />
<br />
Neither of these match the manual. <br />
<br />
Will this cause a problem at inspection, and how should we show the inspectors that these are approved motors?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
The Game Manual Part 1 has been recently updated to remove all specific part numbers. The following motors are legal, regardless of the part number assigned to the product by the manufacturer:<br />
<br />
•	TETRIX 12V DC Motor<br />
•	AndyMark NeveRest series 12V DC Motors<br />
•	Modern Robotics/MATRIX 12V DC Motors<br />
•	REV Robotics HD Hex 12V DC Motor<br />
•	MATRIX 9.6V</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: No, there are no restrictions on gear ratios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-12-2016, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our team has a minibot that comes off of the main robot, the wires are run from the mainbot to the minbot on a rigid scissor extension that is raised 28 inches above the ground to eliminate the risk of entanglement.  It is very similar to this robot design https://youtu.be/ue3FCX6Itew for the 2012-2013 Ring It Up! game except we raise our scissor extension up higher and we do not have slack wires ever (The wires are secured directly to the metal scissor extension bars). Our plan is to bring the minibot back to the mainbot and stop using it as soon as anyone raises to the height of our scissor extension, to prevent tipping both their robot and our robot from tipping over. <br />
 <br />
Question 1: Right now, we are using the minibot just to help pickup particles and bring them to the mainbot to be launched, is this legal? <br />
 <br />
Question 2: We are also considering adding a beacon button pusher to it so it can help us claim the beacons during end game and autonomous, is this legal?  <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Answer 1: The Game Design Committee enjoys seeing how Teams solve the annual game challenge and this Robot is a very creative approach to playing VELOCITY VORTEX. <br />
<br />
The Game Design Committee is not able to give absolute approval to the Robot without an in-person inspection. A Robot Inspector at an event will confirm that the Robot complies with all the construction rules. All that the Game Design Committee can say is that in general, the mini-bot/main-Robot concept described in the post does not appear to violate any construction rules. Keep in mind that the entire Robot must comply with the Robot starting volume rule, &lt;G3&gt;.<br />
<br />
While the construction of the Robot appears to be legal, compliance with game rules will be decided by referees during Match play. Complying with the following game rules could be more challenging for this Robot than it is for a more conventional Robot design.<br />
<br />
&lt;S1&gt; Unsafe Robot<br />
&lt;G15&gt; Destruction, Damage, Tipping, etc.<br />
&lt;G13&gt; Robots Deliberately Detaching Parts<br />
&lt;G16&gt; Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking Robots<br />
&lt;G20&gt; Timely removal of Robots from the Playing Field at the end of a Match<br />
&lt;GS9&gt; Particle interference<br />
&lt;GS10&gt; Blocking Access to an opposing Alliance's Scoring Elements<br />
&lt;GS11&gt; Cap Ball interference<br />
<br />
Blocking Robots, Scoring Elements, and launched Particles are of particular concern. A Robot this big could be a real barrier to allowing free access to Particles, Cap Balls, and Vortex goals.<br />
<br />
Rule &lt;G13&gt; is also a major issue. Robot parts that are released but remain connected by a tether and interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot are considered detached for the purpose of this rule. If the mini-bot or connecting scissor extension interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot, a Major Penalty and a Yellow Card will be issued.<br />
<br />
Finally, for your consideration, how will the mini-bot and rigid scissor extension hold up against a Robot playing defense directly against the mini-bot? FIRST Tech Challenge games are highly interactive; Robot-to-Robot contact and defensive game play should be expected. Is the mini-bot and scissor extension robust enough to survive a push or impact from another Robot?<br />
<br />
Answer 2: Answer #1 also applies to Question #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Professor Proton</div><div class="date">12-13-2016, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question: Is it legal to build a robot that is comprised of 2 minibots connected together by a long tether that stretches across the field?<br />
Answer: A Robot that drags a cable around the Playing Field Floor is an entanglement risk and is not allowed by rule &lt;G15&gt;.<br />
 <br />
Additional concerns include:<br />
1) Particles and Cap Balls drug by the tether would be considered Controlled.<br />
2) Rule &lt;G13&gt; consequences of a Major Penalty and Yellow Card will be issued if a mini-bot or the tether affects game play by an opposing Alliance Robot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Hardware and Software inspections will not routinely check the height of Particle launches.  Per Rule &lt;RG08&gt;, if a referee feels that the Particle is launched at excessive speed or height they can request that a Robot be inspected before being allowed back on the field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Per Rule &lt;RG01.j&gt;, pneumatic tires are illegal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: The requirements for the size of the Team Number are presented in Rule &lt;RG05&gt;.  There are no other signage requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-23-2016, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;RG01.j&gt; says that Pneumatics are Illegal. My first question is do you define pneumatics as the restriction of the movement of air (compressed air). If that is so, my second question would be about parts that would otherwise be used in a pneumatics system but that have been modified to not restrict the movement of air. An example of this would be pneumatic tubing that many teams use that is just used for its rubber shape. Another example would be pneumatic wheels without a valve just used for the rubber shape or parts from a pneumatic actuator, again just used for its construction not for the movement of air.<br />
<br />
A: The restriction is on the use of a compressed fluid.  So employing tubing without filling it with compressed air  (say as used in a collector system or conveyor belting) is legal.  The same goes for a tire that is not inflated, it is legal providing no other rules are violated.</div></div><hr />

When we set the sizing box over the robot, it fits easily because the flails bend down without impeding anything but they do touch the side walls. Is this legal?<br />
<br />
A:  No, this is not legal.  The sizing box is exerting a force on the zip ties causing them to bend and this violates rule &lt;RG02&gt;.</div></div><hr />

They are on our launcher so they are far away from the ground, and since the robot has a very small possibility of tipping so that the wheels touch the ground, we are wondering if they would still be considered legal, as if they were to touch and spin against the field tiles the wheels may possibly damage them?<br />
<br />
link to wheels: http://www.andymark.com/HiGrip-Wheels-p/am-higripwheel.htm<br />
<br />
Would the wheels be considered legal as long as they never touch the ground?<br />
<br />
A:  High grip wheels may not be used in contact where it can damage the field (tiles, ramp, base, etc). All other uses are allowed including using the wheels to launch balls providing the wheels do not produce visible damage to the balls (note that black marks are not considered damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">01-10-2017, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Per our earlier question about zip tie flails extending past the front of the robot. We have four sets of zip ties that are 90 degrees apart. If we remove one set of zip ties, the beater bar can be positioned so that no ties extend past the front of the robot. The other ties will do so when the beater bar is activated, but only then. Will this make the flail mechanism legal because no ties would be touching the sizing box wall?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, this is legal.  This is typically how many of the teams that use flails build their collector systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">01-10-2017, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer to #20 (Robot Inspection and Build Rules / Robot Mechanical Parts and Materials Rules / General Robot Rules) says &quot;The sizing box is exerting a force on the zip ties causing them to bend and this violates rule &lt;RG02&gt;.&quot; <br />
Q: For flexible extensions, are we allowed to manually arrange them (so that no force is exerted) prior to being placed into the sizing box? For example if the robot is moved by the inspector after manual arrangement &amp; sizing, they may pop out slightly beyond the 18&quot;.<br />
<br />
A: The requirement is that the robot remain in the starting configuration when placed on the field and does not expand prior to the start of the Autonomous period.  If you can arrange the extensions in a way that meets this requirement then the robot is legal.  If the extensions pop out during inspection while the Inspector is moving or otherwise interacting with the robot this is not necessarily a reason to fail a robot since this type of interaction will not be present on the field.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">09-25-2016, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can we get a determination on the use of mirrors to redirect the view of the camera in the RC phone to allow more convenient placement of the phone while using image recognition.  Rule &lt;RG03&gt; requires &quot;The Robot Controller MUST be accessible and visible by competition personnel&quot; yet Rule &lt;RE12&gt; says in part that &quot;(for example: lasers and mirrors are not allowed)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please provide a definite ruling.  Thank you for your attention.<br />
<br />
A: Rule &lt;RE12&gt; disallows the use of mirrors for directing robot based light sources.  Mirrors used to direct an image to the camera in the Robot Controller are allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">09-30-2016, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it legal to use the AndyMark AM-3104 motors with BaneBots transmissions to build the robot?  Thanks, and thanks for all you do!<br />
<br />
A: Yes, you may use AM-3104 ( or any other legal motor per Rule &lt;RE09&gt;) with any legal transmission.  Note that shifting transmissions are not legal since they have more than one degree of freedom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">09-30-2016, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;RG01&gt; states &quot;Pneumatics&quot; are not allowed on an FTC robot.  Can you clarify the definition of pneumatic?  Are pneumatic systems defined by the use of compressed air or closed air systems?  Our team is considering using a fan to push air and &quot;particles&quot; through an open pipe.  The fan would be powered by the robot's batteries.  The system would be open, consisting of open pipes and fans - no closed tubing.  All changes in air pressure are due only to pressure changes caused by moving air - as opposed to compressed air tanks.  The moving air would both create a vacuum to suck up &quot;particles&quot;, as well as be able to propel &quot;particles&quot; into vortex goals.  Would this violate rule &lt;RG01&gt;?<br />
<br />
A:  Using a fan and a legal motor to create an air current is allowed.  However, they must be properly guarded so that there is no possibility of these high speed blades coming into contact with a person (team member, FTA, Ref, etc.) or the field.  Robot Inspectors will be instructed to pay particular attention to fan based devices to insure they can be operated safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-03-2016, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team was interested in using a vacuum pump on their robot.  The pump they found runs on 12V, but I do not think the motor attached to the pump is listed in the rules.  If they want to use the pump, do they need to remove the motor that comes on the pump and rewire it with one of the motors listed in the rules?<br />
<br />
A:   Rule &lt;RM02&gt; prohibits the use of COTS parts with more than one degree of freedom and Rule &lt;RM01&gt; prohibits the use of pressurized fluids (pneumatics).  It is impossible to make a ruling without knowing more about the pump in question and whether it violates either of these two rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-04-2016, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to know if is legal to use in the robot:<br />
- EV3 color sensor?<br />
- Gas spring?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
A1: Per Rule &lt;RE01&gt; any sensor is allowed providing it is connected to the Core Device Interface Module.  <br />
<br />
A2:  Gas springs are considered a pneumatic device and per rule &lt;RG01.j&gt; they are  not allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-04-2016, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My team is interested in using an airpo D2028B vacuum pump on their robot.  It has a motor on it that looks similar to the motors we are using on the robot and is 12Vdc, but I cannot find any other specific information about the motor.  Are they allowed to use this pump on the robot?  If not, would they be allowed to remove the motor and wire one of the allowed motors to the pump?<br />
<br />
A1:   The only allowable motors are listed in Rule &lt;RE09&gt;.  Since the motor on the pump is not on the list it is illegal and may not be used.<br />
<br />
A2:   Without seeing the inside of the vacuum pump it is not possible to determine if it is legal.  However if it compresses air in any form it is illegal per rule RG01j, and if there is more than One Degree of Freedom; i.e. pistons, valves, etc. then it is illegal per Rule &lt;RM02&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-13-2016, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In post #3-you state &quot;you may use AM-3104 ( or any other legal motor per Rule &lt;RE09&gt;) with any legal transmission.

<br />
Can i assume that the Banebots P60 256:1 Gearbox w/ Moto (am-2878) is legal.<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
A:  Yes, the P60 gearbox (AM-2878) is a legal COTS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-13-2016, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we allowed to use a linear actuator without a motor?<br />
<br />
A: There are many types of linear actuators. Without more information it is not possible to determine the legality of the part.   Please be more specific on make and model of actuator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-16-2016, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post #3 in the COTS answer thread states that &quot;Note that shifting transmissions are not legal since they have more than one degree of freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Post #4 in the General Robot Rules answer thread states &quot;the TileRunner kit because it comes unassembled and is made of legal components is legal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: Is a shifting transmission that comes unassembled and is made of legal components (all of which are available for individual purchase) legal?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, teams may build their own shifting transmissions from legal materials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-16-2016, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule RG01 states:wheels &quot;that could potentially damage Playing Field components&quot; are not allowed. However, during the ResQ season, these were ruled legal if they did not come in contact with the playing field surface so they could not damage the tiles.   <br />
<br />
Are high traction wheels such as AndyMark HiGrip wheels ( https://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2256.htm) allowed to be used as long as they do not come into contact with the playing field?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
A: High Traction wheels are legal provided they do not come into contact with the playing field (tile floor, Corner Ramp surface, Center Goal Base, Center Goal, etc.).  They may be used in contact with the Particles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
The team is considering the use of the following items as part of the internals of their robots.<br />
<br />
  1. COTS tank tracks from the local hobby store for a conveyor belt<br />
  2. 3D printing tank tracks, sprockets for a conveyor belt<br />
  3. 3D printing custom sized wheels for a counter-rotating firing mechanism.<br />
  4. Creating a variable geometry particle firing mechanism that pivots between two positions. Mechanism will be contained within the body of the robot.<br />
<br />
None of the items should come into contact with the playing surface.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
A:  In the future please ask only one question per post, it makes it easier for the readers to sort and find the answer.<br />
<br />
A1: Yes, tank treads are a legal COTS<br />
A2: 3D printed parts are legal per rule &lt;RM01&gt;<br />
A3: Yes, 3D printed wheels are legal per rule &lt;RM01&gt;<br />
A4: There is no rule preventing teams from building a mechanism that has multiple positions so long as all possible locations remain inside the starting envelope at the start of the match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-04-2016, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Legal-Illegal parts list seems to indicate that they are, but I wanted to confirm that the use of 3rd party gearboxes is legal before we order them.<br />
<br />
A: Yes, 3rd party gearboxes, including the Banebot P60 gearbox, are legal per rule &lt;RM02&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-04-2016, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am curious as the legality of screen door closers and items like that.  I guess that technically they are pneumatics since they utilize air, but it is a closed system.  Ruling?<br />
<br />
A: These devices used a pressurized fluid (air) to operate and are therefore not legal per rule &lt;RG01.j&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-07-2016, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can one use----a One way Bearing Sprag Freewheel Backstop Clutch see  https://goo.gl/V0HukJ on Amazon.com -Legal?<br />
<br />
It resembles a roller bearing, but instead of cylindrical rollers, non-revolving asymmetric figure-eight shaped sprags are used. When the unit rotates in one direction the rollers slip or free-wheel, but when a torque is applied in the opposite direction, the rollers tilt slightly, producing a wedging action and binding because of friction. The sprags are spring-loaded so that they lock with very little backlash.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprag_clutch<br />
<br />
A: Yes, this bearing is a legal part per Rule &lt; RM02&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheldon</div><div class="date">12-20-2016, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Team #5466 would like to ask if a specific linear actuator is allowed and we are referencing the Thread: COTS, question #9.  Our Question: Is the Servo City (https://www.servocity.com/hda10-2) linear actuator allowed with a legal motor? We would not be using the original motor. Thank you for your attention!<br />
<br />
A: The linear actuator without the motor (essentially a leadscrew) is a legal COTS.</div></div><hr />
