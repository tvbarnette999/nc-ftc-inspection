I am a new mentor and I don't see a rule against them; but, I was told "just bring them to a competition and see what happens".<br>
Specifically we are interested in the VEX Tank Tread Kit since the kids are thinking of tread drive.<br>
<br>
A: There is no rule restricting where team may acquire legal parts.  Therefore as long as the VEX parts do not violate any other rule, they are legal.  VEX treads are a legal COTS.</div></div><hr>

A: Devices using compressed fluids (air, CO2, hydraulic, etc.) are not legal.  Rule &lt;RG11&gt; specifically prohibits the launching of parts of the robot, including grappling hooks.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A:  These tires are designated as off road tires and have an extremely aggressive tread that is designed to have high traction.  Rule &lt;RM01.d&gt; prohibits the use of high traction tires.  Therefore they are not a legal part.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">09-24-2015, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello.  When referring to rule 5.3.2 Robot Mechanical Parts and Materials Rules under &lt;RM01&gt; part d, we believe we can use Heavy Duty Rubberized Undercoating to spray on our tank treads for traction.    We have tested the spray, and when dry, it provides increased traction without damaging the playing field.  Are we correct?<br>
<br>
A:  It is impossible to make a determination without seeing the coating in question.  The test the Inspectors will use to determine whether the tread is legal is to run the fully loaded robot against an immovable object (perimeter wall) and then have the teams spin the tires.  It the tires damage the rubber floor tile the teams will be asked to replace the wheels/tread before they can pass inspection</div></div><hr>

<br>
http://www.harborfreight.com/material-handling/solid-flat-free-tires/6-inch-semi-solid-wheel-98950.html<br>
<br>
We are particularly looking at Game Manual 1, Section 5.3.2 Robot Mechanical Parts and Materials Rules, rule &lt;RM01&gt;, item d.<br>
<br>
It says "High traction wheels (e.g. AM- 2256), and high grip tread (e.g. Rough top), that may damage the Playing Field are not allowed."<br>
<br>
We have tested this wheel.  It does not damage the playing field in any way.<br>
<br>
We are concerned about attending a competition and be disqualified based on this rule.<br>
<br>
We'd appreciate your help on this.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
A:  The GDC cannot rule on every possible tire and tread combination.  If the Inspectors suspect that a tire/tread will damage the field then teams will be asked to perform the test outlined in the post from 9-24-2015.  If a robot passes this test then the tire/tread is legal.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A:  The GDC cannot comment on all possible tire/tread combinations but in general the smooth surface tires are legal while the AM-2256 and AM-0940 are considered high traction and would not be legal.  Pneumatic devices of any kind (including tires) are not legal.  However if the tire were to be used without an inflated tube the tire/tread would have to be tested per the test outlined in the post from 9-24-2015.  If a robot equipped with these tires passes the test then it would be legal.</div></div><hr>

      <br>
     We are wondering if it is legal to use Roughtop or any other treads on our robot if it doesn't touch the floor, but only the bars on the mountain?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Team 8668<br>
<br>
A:  If the a tire or tread material, including Roughtop, does not touch the floor then it may be used on any other part of the robot.  Remember that teams are still responsible if their robots damage any part of the playing field so careful use of all materials is advised.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A:  A: The AM-2611 is not considered a high traction tread and is therefore a legal material.  Even though this material is legal teams are still responsible if their robot damages the playing field in any way.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A:  Yes, the SuperDroid tank treads are legal.  However depending on how the treads are used and the weight of the bot, teams using this tread may still be required to demonstrate that their bot passes the test described in the post from 9-24-2015</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding &lt;T6&gt;: Can you clarify what counts as only having "one robot"?  Can we bring one drive-train chassis with different mechanisms that we add, remove, or move depending on whether we are on the blue or red alliance, provided we go through inspection in both our blue and red configurations?<br>
<br>
To be clear what we are asking about, the following questions arose in our discussions and we were not sure whether they would be allowed under &lt;T6&gt; or not: Can a team move their zipline releaser from one side of their robot to another depending on their alliance color?  Can a team bring a "red side" zipline releaser mechanism and a different "blue side" zipline releaser mechanism and install the appropriate mechanism on a match-by-match basis depending on their alliance color?  Can a team bring a "red scoring top" and a "blue scoring top" that they connect and screw on top of their drive chassis with multiple different mechanisms depending on whether or not they're on the red or blue alliance in a given match?  The red and blue scoring tops might be a large part of their overall robot configuration (maybe 50% or more by size and weight).  In all cases, we would assume that the robot would have to go through inspection in all configurations?  We are hoping for an answer to the broad question at the top that would allow us to better figure out the answers to these other questions on our own.  )<br>
<br>
A:  Each registered team may enter only one robot (a robot built to play FIRST RES-Q) into the FIRST Tech Challenge Competition.  At the time of Inspection, the Robot must be presented with all Mechanisms (including all components of each mechanism), configurations, and decorations that will be used on the Robot during the competition event. It is acceptable, however, for a robot to play matches with a subset of the mechanisms that were present during inspection. Only mechanisms that were present during the inspection may be added, removed, or reconfigured between matches. If mechanisms are changed between matches, the reconfigured robot must still meet all the inspection criteria. All robot rules still apply and the robot and all mechanisms together can’t exceed the maximum permitted number of motors, sensors, etc<br>
<br>
Event guidelines guarantee a minimum of 5 minutes between matches. Matches will not be delayed for a team to change mechanisms.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FTC10118</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your answer to team FTC 10131, you indicated that "At the time of Inspection, the Robot must be presented with all Mechanisms (including all components of each mechanism), configurations, and decorations that will be used on the Robot during the competition event."<br>
<br>
Would it not also be the case that all of the Mechanisms (both "Red" and "Blue" as described in the question) must be attached to the robot and that the robot must fit inside the Robot Sizing Box per &lt;RG03&gt; at the time of Inspection?  <br>
<br>
Or, are you indicating with your answer that there is a provision for having additional parts/mechanisms that are not attached at the time of inspection but are merely presented to the judges?  And, if that is the case, would these additional parts/mechanisms just be placed in the Robot Sizing Box, unattached, to make sure that the volume of everything is within 18 cubic inches?<br>
<br>
A: Each version of the robot will be inspected (placed in the sizing box) separately. At  Inspection the "Red" version will be inspected then the team will have to reassemble the robot into the "Blue" configuration and have that version inspected.  Remember that the combined # of motors, servos, etc. for all the mechanisms together cannot exceed the number as stated in the rules.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Our team is planning to use zip-ties on wheels. Are zip-ties on wheels allowed? The game manual prevents the use of anything that damages the playing field. Zip-ties do not damage the playing field but they leave an imprint on the game floor. Is this considered as damaging the playing field?<br>
<br>
A: Zip ties on a wheel are allowed.  However, remember that the test for evaluating wheel damage is a dynamic test and is described in the post from 9-24-2015.  Depending on how the zip ties are used, the weight of the bot, etc. the Inspector may require the team demonstrate that their design does not damage the tiles.</div></div><hr>

If the part remains attached to the robot (i.e.tethered to the robot) when does it become launching and not just extending outside of the original dimensions.   Does this rule limit the manner in which the robot can extend its size.  Could a tethered hook of some sort be released by the robot as long as it is tethered to the robot and attach to the bar for the endgame?<br>
<br>
A:There is no limit to how far a robot can extend.  A hook tethered to a robot can be used to attach to the bar.  Safety concerns prohibit the launching of the hook. For instance; a rigid arm may be used to place a tethered hook onto the bar but a hook that is thrown into the air with a high initial velocity and is connected to the robot while moving only by a non-rigid cable or wire is unsafe and is illegal.</div></div><hr>

<br>
For robot suspension systems, what is the legality of shock absorbers? I have read that the Actobotics ones are illegal (If you do not mind me asking, what was the reasoning behind this? Just curious) but what about other ones? (such as www.hobbypeople.net/index.php/rc-cars-trucks/parts-hopups/suspension-parts/shocks-complete/traxxas-shocks-w-red-springs-bigbore-8-t-e-maxx.html)<br>
What about the use of coil springs and axles with linear bearings (Basically homemade shocks) to allow for robot suspension?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
SnakeByte 4546<br>
<br>
A: Shock absorbers are pneumatic devices that use a compressed fluid to operate.  Pneumatics of any kind (gas or liquid) are illegal. Also, rule &lt; RG02.g&gt; prohibits the use of components that contain liquid or gel materials.  Coil springs are allowed per rule &lt;RM01.b&gt; and linear bearings are allowed per rule &lt;RM01.c&gt;.</div></div><hr>

<br>
(1) Would the shocks be allowed (https://www.servocity.com/html/aluminum_robot_shocks__585032_.html#.VhAKEvlViko ) if we were to drain the oil and add a compression spring as the buffering device, or would it exceed the degree of freedom requirement?<br>
<br>
(2) Can we make our own shocks out of standard Tetrix Tubing, Axle shafts, Compression and Tension Springs, Bearings, Washers, nuts, and bolts? It would function identically to the above shock except be built of individual components by our team.<br>
<br>
Team 8881<br>
Pirates of the Pacific<br>
<br>
A1:  The shock absorber without the oil (or other fluid) is simply a linear slide and is a legal COTS.  It is the compressed fluid that gives the device it's shock absorbing properties.  Without the fluid the "shock absorber" is nothing more than a spring.  <br>
<br>

<br>
A: There are no restrictions on where teams may purchase legal parts, therefore Vex or Vex Pro parts are allowed as long as they do not violate any other rules.  Rule &lt;RM01.d&gt; specifically restricts the use of "high traction" wheels and since the Versa wheel advertises itself as having "superior traction" it is not allowed.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">10-05-2015, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your answer to our question about the One Robot rule in post #18 of the Robot Mechanical Q&amp;A thread.<br>
<br>
A follow up question: your ruling says in part: "At the time of Inspection, the Robot must be presented with all Mechanisms (including all components of each mechanism), configurations, and decorations that will be used on the Robot during the competition event. It is acceptable, however, for a robot to play matches with a subset of the mechanisms that were present during inspection."<br>
<br>
Does this mean either:<br>
<br>
A: That the robot must have all mechanisms present on the robot and inspection, and pass inspection with all mechanisms on the robot (e.g., must fit within the 18" cube with all mechanisms on the robot, even if half the mechanisms would be used if blue and the other half used if red),<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
B: That the robot must have all mechanisms present at inspection, with the possibility of some mechanism configurations being off the robot at inspection time (e.g., we come to inspection with the robot in the "blue" configuration which passes inspection, sizing, etc., and also have on the side (and not physically attached to the robot at the time) the "red" configuration mechanisms which can be swapped out with the "blue" mechanisms to compete in "red" mode and which also pass inspection in the swapped state).<br>
<br>
A: Each version of the robot will be inspected separately.  Remember that the total number of motors, servos, etc. for all mechanisms cannot exceed the quantities described in the game manual.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A:  The linear slide/leadscrew combination is a legal COTS.  However, the pivoting clamp on the saddle is a separate degree of freedom.  This must be removed to make the device legal.  Teams may couple a legal motor to the leadscrew using legal parts (gears, belts, couplers, etc.)</div></div><hr>

Our team is planning to use the TETRIX® MAX All-Terrain Tire as wheels for our robot. Is this wheel legal?<br>

<br>
Thank you, <br>
Team 7171<br>
Shockwave Robotics<br>
<br>
A:  The FTC Forum has received many questions about legal/illegal wheels and tread types for this season’s game. If a Team has a question about a particular tread, the first step is to visit the FTC Forum to see if the question has already been addressed in the forum. <br>
 The next step a Team can take is to test the tread prior to competition, which mitigates the risk of a Team arriving at a competition with a tread that can potentially damage the field. Prior to the Competition, Teams should place the robot on top of a field tile and against an immovable surface (wall), and run the wheels at full power for 15 seconds. If there is any physical damage to the floor tile then the wheels will not be allowed. Discoloration or black marks alone are not considered field damage. Remember, the test must be made with the robot at the weight the bot will be at during the Competition since this will affect the degree of damage.<br>
 Robot Inspectors will perform this same test at an Event if they have concerns about the Robot’s wheels or tread damaging the playing field.</div></div><hr>

A: Yes, teams may make their own tread/tracks providing they are made from allowed materials.  Remember that custom treads must pass the same field damage test as purchased tires/treads.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A: The spray is legal providing the coating does not leave any residue on the playing field (tiles, mountain, etc.).  Any residue will be considered field damage and the team will be penalized. Also, some venues may restrict the use of aerosol sprays, so check with the event organizers before using the spray at a competition.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">10-11-2015, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;RM01.d&gt; states:<br>
High traction wheels (e.g. AM- 2256), and high grip tread (e.g. Rough top), that may damage the Playing Field are not allowed.<br>
<br>
We are trying to better understand the intent of this rule. Our team's understanding of this rule is that the intent is to prevent field damage caused by high traction or high grip wheels. Thus the explanation both last year and this year about how to test your robot to see if the tires will damage the field.<br>
<br>
However,  the answer to forum post #6 states "Rule &lt;RM01.d&gt; prohibits the use of high traction tires." It seems to us that the rule states that the high traction tires that may damage the field are not allowed. Not all high traction tires are not allowed. <br>
<br>
The reason I ask is that our team has quite a collection of tires including the tires asked about in forum post #6, AM-2256 and wheels with rough top tread. And the wheels sold by Servo City are very soft and in our testing are not damaging the field while the AM-2256 and rough top wheels are both very hard (and rough) and could definitely damage the field. If the intent of the rule is solely about field damage, then a follow-up question is: Has someone with FTC tested or handled these tires and do you believe these tires would cause field damage? Because I think the picture and description might be a bit misleading regarding the possibility of field damage.<br>
<br>
A: No, FIRST cannot possibly test all the available tires and treads. Field damage is also dependent on robot weight, number of motors driving the wheels, etc.  It is up to the teams to demonstrate that their robot does not damage the field.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">10-11-2015, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that high traction wheels (such as these AndyMark wheels https://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2256.htm) are not allowed according to the rule book, but in a previous question it had been deemed legal to use them as long as they did not touch the playing field floor and did not damage the field in any way. <br>
so would it be legal to use a high traction wheel if we were to cover the wheel in another material so that it is not actually touching the playing field floor?<br>
<br>
A: The AM-2256 wheels may not be used in contact with the tile floor so if they are covered they are not technically in contact with the floor so the wheel is legal.  Since these tires have caused problems in the past,  teams will still have to demonstrate that their robot does not damage the floor. If during testing the Inspectors deem that the robot causes field damage, the robot will not pass inspection.</div></div><hr>

<br>
The 10-08-2015 Q&amp;A post (#39) in the "Robot Inspection and Build Rules" thread defines how tires can be tested for passing inspection.  We have tested a cogged drive belt idea and the prototype design failed the test requirement: "run the wheels at full power for 15 seconds".  The wheels spun and abraded the surface of the tile.  See video of test: https://youtu.be/-63vg4V7UfM<br>
<br>
Question: May we limit the power of the wheels in programming so that static friction force is not exceeded by the torque from the motor and the wheels do not spin?Is "full power" 100% of motor controller available power, or 100% of game controller command to robot.<br>
<br>
a: If there is any possibility that the motor will run at 100% power during either autonomous or tele-operated mode, then the tread must be tested at 100% power. It is a violation of Gracious Professionalism for a team to run the motors at one power during inspection and at a higher power level during a match.  Teams that are caught doing this will be disqualified from the event.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">10-26-2015, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding tread legality, there have been some tires and tank tracks declared illegal on this forum. Others, which still look pretty aggressive, are given conditional approval. This makes it hard for the teams to decide how aggressive to go. Please clarify the specifics of how tires or tank tracks will be ruled upon. Will the judges be able to declare a tread illegal with just a visual inspection? Can the judges refuse a team’s request to test a tire/track? <br>
<br>
We have ordered some field squares so we can be sure our choice will not damage the surface. It would be very disappointing to be declared illegal at an event and not given the chance to prove the tire and robot combination will not harm the surface.<br>
<br>
A: Judges do not rule on tread legality.  This is done at Inspection on the day of the event.  Teams will be given the opportunity to demonstrate that their robot does not damage the field tiles.</div></div><hr>

Does this mean that we should expect that any tread that will pass inspection and the usage test specified (i.e., a 30 second trial on the field, running in place at full speed) is legal?<br>
<br>
A: If a robot passes inspection it will be allowed to compete in a match.  A Referee always has the option to request a re-inspection if they believe there is an issue with the robot.  They also can assign penalties if they notice the robot has damaged the field.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Our current wheels are made entirely out of car tire rubber, and yesterday at our scrimmage we left a lot of rubber on the field. We know the test you keep saying to use, and we have tested it, the wheels do not scar the field at all. There is no damage to the field, just black marks on the field and mountain. What are your rules on this? There is no actual damage, no cuts or pulls or anything, just black. Is this against rules and will we be disqualified for leaving some black rubber on the field? <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

A robot utilizes two large wheels on the outside of the robot (like a Star Wars tie-fighter). The robot deploys 'training wheels' that unfold during the competition to keep the robot from rolling away when not engaged. While the training wheels are folded, the robot fits perfectly into the 18" sizing box. <br>
<br>
But, the robot rolls and touches the edges of the sizing box when the training wheels are folded up for measuring.<br>
<br>
Can the team use temporary chocks that hold the robot in place specifically for the measurement portion of the competition, as long as the robot and chocks together fit inside the sizing box?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
A: Rule &lt;RG03&gt; states that the maximum size of a robot for starting a match (when placed on the field) is 18"  The sizing box is simply a convenient gauge for determining compliance with this rule.  If chocks are used to hold the training wheels in place then these chocks must remain with the robot and be in place when the robot is placed on the field.</div></div><hr>

Q2: And also what is the exact definition of 'control' when it comes to the debris?<br>
A1: Yes, teams may use legally constructed fans to "blow away" Debris. Fans must be properly guarded so that there is no possibility of the blades coming into contact with a person (team member, FTA, Ref, etc.) or the Playing Field (rule &lt;RG02.a&gt;). Robot Inspectors will be instructed to pay particular attention to fan based devices to insure they can be operated safely.<br>

  We're considering modifying a motorized tape measure to extend a hook to the pull-up bar. The model is a Black and Decker A100 seen here:<br>
<br>
http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-ATM100-25-Foot-Measure/dp/B0002TG1GG<br>
<br>
The modification would be to remove the existing motor (and batteries) and have one of the approved motors couple to the gearing mechanism inside.<br>
(n.b. this would only be for hooking the pull-up bar. The robot would be lifted by a separate winch with stronger gears using some 100 lb fishing in line.)<br>
<br>
Would such a modified device be allowed?<br>
<br>
A: Without seeing the internal arrangement of the tape measure it is difficult to answer the question but in principle this should be legal.  Just make sure that that the internal system that drives the tape forward does not have more than one degree of freedom.</div></div><hr>

I seem to remember in FRC all attachments need to fit inside the size limit.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;I7&gt; At the time of Inspection, the Robot must be presented with all mechanisms (including all components of<br>
each mechanism), configurations, and decorations that will be used on the Robot during the competition. It is<br>
acceptable for a Robot to play Matches with a subset of the mechanisms that were present during inspection.<br>
Only mechanisms that were present during Inspection may be added, removed, or reconfigured between<br>
Matches. The Robot should be assembled in a typical configuration used for Match play when reporting for<br>
inspection.<br>
c. Robot and all mechanisms must be inspected in every starting configuration.<br>
d. If mechanisms are swapped out between Matches, the reconfigured Robot must still meet all Robot<br>
rules and inspection criteria.<br>
e. The sum total of all electronics (motors, servos, Modern Robotics modules, Android devices, etc.) used<br>
in the construction of all of the mechanisms and base Robot, whether they are used on the Robot at the<br>

The current design involves a motor attached to a U-channel, which is then attached to another u-channel using an axle (Please see the attached pictures).  We have also made a grappling hook that is attached to a rope which the arm swings, which functions similarly to a trebuchet.  The hook we built has no sharp points or edges and cannot come loose from the robot.  It is attached to the robot by a thick rope - to a permanently-mounted winch system which pulls our robot up off the ground.<br>
We recently looked over the rules again to make sure all components and designs are legal, and we noticed that there is a rule that prohibits us from using our arm design, RG11. Rule RG11 states that parts of the robot itself may not be launched.  We are not in violation of any other parts of this rule, but we do not think that we are truly “launching” anything.<br>
The hook will never unattach from the robot during play, nor will any other component.  That same rule, RG11, also stated that a game element can be launched by the robot. There is no reason for a robot to launch a game element while still attached to it, meaning that the game element is not attached.  Because our hook will be continuously attached to our robot, we believe that by the FTC usage of the work “launch”, we are swinging our hook, not launching it.  The hook is always connected to our robot, and does not travel further than 5 feet vertically or 10 feet horizontally. With this in mind, are we violating any rules with our design?<br>

A: Yes, this is a legal design providing no other rules are violated.</div></div><hr>

For our design, we'd like to be able to reverse the ratcheting mechanism without removing the wrench from the robot. To do so, we would like to use a reversible ratcheting wrench. This quote from McMaster describes the difference between the two:<br>
<br>
"Ratcheting combination wrenches are flat. Flip them over to reverse ratchet action.<br>
<br>
Reversible ratcheting combination wrenches have a lever on the box end that reverses direction. Ratchet is offset 15° for work in hard-to-reach areas. The offset also provides a more comfortable grip."<br>

<br>
A: A reversible ratcheting wrench has two separate actions that are independent of each other, the rotating socket and a different rotating (or sliding) latch each of which require a separate powered input.

We've been surprised by the ruling on some of the items, and have come to realize that we must not clearly understand how you are determining if a mechanism is considered single degree of freedom or not.  If we can get output of only one direction (no rotation), wouldn't that be a single degree of freedom?  But, you sometimes clarify that the internals must be single degree of freedom, not just the output.  So, can you point us somewhere to study and understand the criteria better so we can make better judgments?<br>
<br>
A: The GDC is using the single DOF term rather loosely.  The intent is to encourage teams to design their own mechanisms rather than just purchasing a pre-designed and pre-manufactured solution.  In general if a device can be powered by a single motion input, the GDC is considered that to be a single DOF (such as a planetary gearbox) but if it requires two inputs (such as a shifting gearbox) it is a not legal.  Also, pre-made grippers or other devices that are sold primarily to play FIRST Res-Q are illegal.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
A: Robots must be sized in the orientation that they will be placed onto the field. So if the any side of the robot is 24" when the robot is placed on it's wheels (tread) it will not fit into the sizing box and is not legal.</div></div><hr>

We are the philobots, team 9048, and we have a question concerning one of our robot's sub-systems. We are currently using a Ball Shifter, which can be found here: http://www.vexrobotics.com/217-4098.html. We used the ball shifter that did not come in an assembly with the gears, and we were wondering if this piece would be legal in the FTC game. Please let us know. Thanks!<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">01-20-2016, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello ftc,<br>
<br>
I'm asking about the two rules RG10 and RG11 in the game manual and whether the following scenario is allowed.<br>
<br>
The rules in question are these:<br>
&lt;RG10&gt; Energy used by FIRST Tech Challenge Robots, (i.e., stored at the start of a Match), shall come only from the following sources:<br>
	• Electrical energy derived from approved batteries.<br>
	• A change in the position of the Robot center of gravity.<br>
	• Storage achieved by deformation of Robot parts. Teams must be very careful when incorporating spring-like mechanisms or other items to store energy on their Robot by means of part or material deformation.<br>
&lt;RG11&gt; Game elements launched by Robots should not have a velocity greater than that required to reach a maximum of 1.5 meters (5 feet) above the lowest point of the Robot, nor travel a horizontal distance greater than 3 meters (10 feet) from the point that the game element ends contact with the Robot. Parts of the Robot itself may not be launched.<br>
<br>
The scenario in question is:<br>
An object such as a grappling hook, being launched within the set velocity limits, using a spring mechanism to store energy. The grappling hook is also very safe and connected to the robot, thereby not violating &lt;G13&gt; Robots Deliberately Detaching Parts. The last sentence of RG11 "Parts of the Robot itself may not be launched." needs clarification because how it is worded right now, it is to prevent the violation of G13. Therefore, we think that a grappling hook attached to the robot with a thick rope does not violate G13 and RG11. <br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
A:  Launching a grappling hook, even if connected by a rope or cable, is not allowed.</div></div><hr>

<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
A:  The intent of the robot construction rules is for the robot to be no larger than an 18” cube. The sizing box is a tool for enforcing the size rule.  If a team believes the sizing box is incorrect then they should talk with the lead inspector and respectfully challenge the sizing box as being small. The lead inspector can make the appropriate judgement call to pass or not pass the robot based on their assessment of the quality of the sizing box.  Teams should be aware of the dangers of designing to the very limits of robot size.</div></div><hr>

 <br>
We are thinking of using a TETRIX Max Worm Gear Box on the robot. We are not sure if this is legal or not.  <br>
The TETRIX Max Worm Gear Box utilizes a 4:1 gear ratio for slow and smooth rotational motion<br>
<br>
http://www.tetrixrobotics.com/Gears_and_Sprockets/TETRIX_MAX/TETRIX_Worm_Gear_Box<br>
<br>
A:  Rule &lt;RM01.c&gt;  allows the use of single degree of freedom COTS gear boxes, which includes a worm gear box.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avalanche</div><div class="date">01-25-2016, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a static part which is completely legal.  Sometimes we place this on our robot and sometimes we give it to our alliance partners.<br>
<br>
The part does not extend the robot beyond the 18" limit, and has no electrical or moving parts.  Our robot passes inspection with it attached.<br>
<br>
The question came up at our last match if we should have our partners re-inspected when we place this part on their robot.   If we add a minor bolt or tetrix part, to their (or our) robot it seems obvious that no re-inspection is necessary.  On the other hand, giving our partners a complete complicated assembly would seem to require a re-inspection.  <br>
<br>
Can you give us any guidance to help clarify what is deemed necessary for a robot to be re-inspected for our refs/inspectors at our next tournament?<br>
<br>
A: If a team adds parts to the robot that changes or enhances performance (vs. just a fastener) that robot must be re-inspected prior to being allowed to play in their next match.  Teams that are planning to modify their bot between matches should be aware that Robot Inspectors typically have other duties once matches begin so getting a bot re-inspected may take some time.</div></div><hr>

<br>
A: Yes, wrapping wheels with a tape that will not result in field damage is allowed. The properties of gaffers tape with regard to field damage is not well known so teams using this may be required to prove to the Inspectors that the robot will not damage the tiles.</div></div><hr>

Would one or both of the following inexpensive scopes be permitted?  While they are COTS, I'm not sure if the zero, elevation and windage adjustments would violate the 1-DOF requirement (and the red-dot scope has an internal battery to power it's light source). They also include mounts.  Please note these are NOT laser sights, just scopes.<br>

1. Optical Scope, e.g., http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052G6I2G<br>

<br>
A1:  The Optical scope has three adjustments that allow motion in three directions essentially providing three degrees of freedom.  There fore the scope is not a legal COTS part.<br>
<br>
A2:  Since the scope is a functional, not decorative, device it must be powered by the main battery.  The internal battery is illegal.</div></div><hr>

Part c. says "The numerals must each be at least 7.62cm high (3.0 inches), at least in 1.27cm (0.5 inches) stroke width, and in a contrasting color from their background."  The answers to posts #68 &amp; #74 mention only "field personnel can clearly and easily determine the team" or "as long as the numbers can be easily read by the field personnel" which refers to part a. without mention of the specific size outlined in part c.  Strictly following part c. creates a very large number that can be difficult to mount and also may cover motor and servo controllers making troubleshooting during competition more difficult. <br>
<br>
During inspection at our most recent event we were told our 2.25 in high and clearly visible numbers weren't big enough.  As we and other teams advance to area championships and beyond is the intent to enforce part c., or part a.?  <br>

Our understanding is that as explained in post #94 the gearbox is considered a separate part and can be modified in any way as long as no other rules are violated. <br>
<br>
The reason we are asking about this is that we purchased some HS-785hb sail winch servos to be use on a part of the robot that under high loads. They are fairly powerful servos but the gearbox has Karbonite gears and is not strong enough to take the full amount of power that the servo can produce. We wanted to replace the Karbonite gears with metal ones but there was no direct replacement. We instead purchased a metal gearset that was made for the HS-755mg servo. The gears are almost a perfect fit, but still needed some modification to work. Is this legal?<br>
