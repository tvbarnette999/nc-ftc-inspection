Sort of like an FRC drivers station with a small ledge.<br>
<br>
1. We would like to make a small briefcase to told the driver station phone and controllers when transporting. Would this be allowed? <br>
2a. Are we allowed to use a small tripod that holds the phones and controllers? <br>
2b. Would it have to be within the drivers box, or can it sit between the drivers box and field?<br>
<br>
Hello Team!<br>
<br>
Tournaments will supply a small stand for each alliance to place their controllers and driver station on for the autonomous portion of the match.<br>
<br>
Your team may make a small briefcase to transport the driver station phone and controllers.<br>
You may not bring a small tripod to the field to hold the phone and controller.<br>
Additional materials may not be brought to the competition area.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-05-2015, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am building the DIY mountain and was wondering about the heights of the hurdles. The DIY version calls for 1"x2"s (1-1/2" high) hurdles for the lower mountain and 1"x4"s (3-1/2" high) for the upper hurdles. The Andy-Mark mountain uses churros which are 1/2" dia. At what height (from flat panel to top of churros) are the churros installed on the competition mountain? <br>
On the AndyMark Competition Fields, the top of the churro to the top of the panel is 1.34". The DIY field hurdle is 1.5" nominally and that would shrink if a team elects to add the sheep plastic to the lowest section of the mountain. The allowance was built in for Teams that would like to add the plastic sheet, as the plastic sheet recommended in the DIY guide acts more similarly to the Competition Fields.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Microburst</div><div class="date">10-12-2015, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the Field Configuration Guide found under the volunteer resources:<br>
<br>
"Affiliate Partners, Event Directors, and Teams are encouraged to use the type of stand that works best for them and is readily available. We encourage you to come up with creative solutions; however we also encourage you to steer clear of using metal stands, as these could block the signal from the Driver Station to the Robot Controller. Tables are also not a viable option, as they block the Team’s ability to see the Field or their Robot. This also hinders the sightlines for the FTA and Referees on the Field."<br>
<br>
We are confused because a previous forum post as to if we will be able to make our own stand and bring it to the field or if we have to use the repurposed rolling goal stands. Can you clarify this?<br>
<br>
Sorry about the confusion. The guidelines cited above are for Event Organizers. We'll make sure to update the resource so it doesn't suggest that teams should bring their own drivers station stand.<br>
<br>
Event Organizers will provide a stand for teams to use to hold their drivers station phones and controllers during autonomous, and to hold their drivers station phones, if they wish, during driver controlled periods. Alternately, teams may use an armband to hold their phones for the duration of the match. Please be advised that if your robot is having trouble, the first place an FTA will look for your drivers station phone is on the stand. <br>
<br>
If teams wish to practice with a stand that is likely to be similar to what event organizers will provide, they may make one using game elements from last season, or purchase one from AndyMark.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry about the confusion. I hope this helps.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Microburst</div><div class="date">10-12-2015, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the initial releases of the new technology I thought it was inferred that we would be able to create our own stand to keep the phones on during autonomous and Tele-Op. This stand would provide a way for the drivers to see the drivers station phone and read data off of it that the robot may be sending to it. From the most recent post it sounds as if we are only allowed to bring our robot, driver station phone, and up to 2 gamepads to the competition area. It also sounds as if we have to sit our phones on a stand during autonomous that we will share with our alliance and once tele-op starts then either leave it on the shared stand or have the coach hold it. Can you clarify this ruling?<br>
<br>
Hello!<br>
<br>
At the field, the event organizer will provide two drivers station stands for each alliance box.  One of the three team members in the drivers box may hold the phone after the Autonomous Period is over, or leave it on the stand. Alternately, a team member may 'wear' the phone in an armband. Please note that if a robot is having trouble on the field, the first place an FTA will look for the drivers station phone is on the drivers station stand.</div></div><hr>

<br>
To be clear what we are asking about, the following questions arose in our discussions and we were not sure whether they would be allowed under &lt;RG07&gt; or not: Can teams mount their driver stations (Android device, cables, hub) together on one small handheld board to make them easier to carry and to help make sure that the cables don't become unplugged during a match?  Can teams bring boxes or small tables to the match to put their Driver Station hardware in or on as long as they are below the height of the field perimeter?  Can teams use alternate USB hubs or do they have to use the FTC kit hubs?<br>
Tournaments will supply a small stand for each alliance to place their controllers and driver station on for the autonomous portion of the match.<br>
Your team can mount the drivers station to a handheld board for easier transportation of the driver station phone and controllers.<br>
You may not bring boxes or tables to the field to hold the drivers station. <br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-19-2015, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The zip line trigger paddle assembly is VERY vague, and could really effect matches if people interpret them differently.  Once a zip line trigger paddle is moved forward, should it be assembled such that it stays down?  Or, should it be assembled loosely so that it pops back up again?  We believe it should most likely stay down so that as you trigger the ones further up the mountain, those zip liners can fall down.  However, if the paddles are assembled loosely, if you trigger #1, and it releases its zip liner and it pops back up, then if you trip #2, you would have to trip #1 again to release #2.  <br>
<br>
The instructions are not clear at all, and in fact, they state the paddles should move freely.  If we read that correctly, this makes the zip line triggering MUCH more difficult.  Please clarify this field assembly question so that each event can have these units assembled properly.<br>
<br>
FTC 6981<br>
<br>
Hi Team, <br>
<br>
The Zip Line Triggers are design so that once they have been triggered by a Robot and the Climber is released, the trigger should go back to its starting orientation. The release mechanism at the top of the mountain should remain open so that it doesn’t block subsequent climbers.  <br>
<br>
Please see the most recent version of the Field Assembly Guide on the FTC Game Page for further instructions to verify the Zip Line is set up correctly, and how to test the Zip Line release system.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-19-2015, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After installing the release and triggers for the ziplines it appears that the releases return to their position once let go.  So if you hit the second release you will need to hit the first release again in order to release the yellow man down the zipline.  So essentially the triggers must be done in reverse order, is this accurate?<br>

However, I wanted to know specifically if we would be allowed to use a phone mount for the remote, similar to this: http://www.amazon.com/Controller-Gamepad-Extendable-PlayStation-Samsung/dp/B00TAUK97A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444442565&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=phone+clip+gamepad<br>
<br>
Now, I know that we are not allowed to touching the remote during the autonomous period, but this would certainly be easier than having the phone sitting on the floor or having driver 2 hold it.<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-22-2015, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are wondering if the mountain baskets are going to be attached to the mountain? If they aren't attached, then putting debris in the wrong way or dumping them would make the whole basket fall over, and give the other team points. If they aren't going to be attached, is it against the rules to pick up the basket with the robot, put debris in it, and put it back on the mountain?<br>
<br>
The Goal Baskets are attached to the Mountain using zip ties. Please see page 10 of the AndyMark Field Setup Guide (http://www.firstinspires.org/node/4271) located on the FIRST website.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-29-2015, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have found a large inconsistency in the release mechanisms of the Zip liners on our official field. One way we found (along with other teams), to remove some of the inconsistency, is to have a small rubber band per release at the top, rather than having 1 reg/large band.<br>
<br>
Q1: Is there any way that the 1 regular rubberband can be replaced on the official fields, to 3 small rubberbands?<br>
<br>
If not:<br>
<br>
Q2: The Low trigger is pressed, releasing the zipliner. Then the Mid Trigger is pressed, but the zipliner gets stuck on the Low Release, do we need to hit the Low Trigger again, or do we get the points after hitting the Mid Trigger, even though the zipliner did not slide down.<br>
Q3: Same for the High Zipliner, Do we need to have the zipliners slide down in order to get the points, or will we get the points if they get stuck after hitting the trigger. (This seems like a lot for the referees to watch for...)<br>
<br>
Q1 Answer: Official Competition Fields will follow the instructions in the Field Setup Guide which is one rubber band.<br>
<br>
Q2 and Q3 Answer: Rule &lt;GS14&gt; leaves room for the Referee to make the final determination on whether points should be awarded to a Team if the trigger was engaged, yet the Climber did not release down the zip line:<br>
<br>
"Referees will also award credit for releasing a Climber under the following circumstances:<br>
a.    A Trigger appears to be engaged and the corresponding Climber does not release and travel the entire length of the Zip Line.<br>
b.    A Trigger rotates from an engaged/Scored orientation back to its pre-Match starting orientation after the corresponding Climber has been released by a valid method."</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">10-29-2015, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answers to two previous questions (http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4632-Tournament-Rules-Answer-Thread&amp;p=18485&amp;viewfull=1#post18485 and http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?4632-Tournament-Rules-Answer-Thread&amp;p=18489&amp;viewfull=1#post18489) refer to team "wearing the phone on an armband".<br>
<br>
We feel that this does not solve the problem of strain relief for the OTG cable which would be dangling from the driver station device, with the additional strain contributed by the USB hub and two attached gamepads.<br>
<br>
Our plan was to build a board to securely fasten the driver station phone, OTG cable, and USB hub to a solid surface and clip down the USB cables leading to the game pads. It would also facilitate the coach being able to monitor telemetry information (which would seem to necessarily involve motion of the driver station device).<br>
<br>
Can we build such a board? I envision a piece of wood, probably 6"x8", perhaps with handle holes to grab (like a kitchen cutting board - either protrusions or oval-shaped holes).<br>

<br>
Teams have the freedom to be creative in how they will carry all of their Drivers Station components to and from the Competition Field, and the setup explained above is legal. However, Teams must use the stands provided by the Event Host, and cannot bring their own to the Competition Field.</div></div><hr>

As the tape is shown in the official assembly guide, can we assume that the tape will be used at "Official Tournaments" to prevent the color bleed.<br>
<br>
Official Competition Fields must follow the instructions outlined in the Field Setup Guide, and must use tape inside the Rescue Beacons in order to prevent the color from bleeding over.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">11-02-2015, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have tested our robot on our team's Res-Q mountain from Andymark, and found we were able to climb our own blue and red painted panels effectively.  Over the weekend our team went to a "Build Day" at our state FIRST organization's field house.  On the Andymark mountain at our state's facility, we were unable to achieve sufficient traction to climb.  The panels seemed slipperier than our teams' own panels.  Questioning our state's volunteer officials, they indicated that the panels were slipperier on one side than the other, and that they had chosen to put the slippery side up, to provide a greater challenge to the teams.  <br>
<br>
Has this difference between the apparently identical sides of the panels been noticed elsewhere, and what is the appropriate assembly configuration?  It seems like this may be a somewhat subtle difference, but one which could have a lot of influence on the performance of robots on the mountain.  We are considering partially dismantling our mountain to see if flipping the panels makes a difference in our robot's climbing performance.  <br>
<br>
If there is a difference in the two panel surfaces, how can the difference be determined in the field, and what is the proper configuration for tournaments?  <br>
<br>
Team 9915<br>
Both sides of the panels used on the Mountains were measured and tested. The difference in the coefficient of friction was so nominal that it was determined either side could be used with little to no difference in game play.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">11-05-2015, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our school's 2 FTC teams (3734 and 6832) are among the teams that are pursuing the use of the ZTE phone's camera as a sensor that locates and tracks the red/blue beacons in autonomous mode. Our algorithmic approach requires collecting and storing "training data" from the red/blue beacons in the specific ambient light environment of a specific tournament venue (gym or ballroom) on a specific competition day. Will teams be allowed to take a few snapshots (or possibly short videos) of the lit beacons on the RES-Q game fields, before tournament play begins? How about between games, if the judges feel that some time can be allowed for it?<br>
<br>
A few camera snapshots or video frames, when processed appropriately, can provide the pattern recognition data that the robots can read from stored files and use during autonomous mode. The possibilities for the students to learn about image processing and pattern recognition will be HUGE!<br>
Calibration of a camera or sensor may be allowed during Field Inspection on competition day. Teams must understand that the location of Field Inspection varies between events, and teams might have to calibrate their cameras and sensors on the Practice Fields if this is where Field Inspection is taking place. <br>
<br>
Teams will not have access to the Competition Fields throughout the day to make modifications to their robot or sensors. Additionally, matches will not wait for teams to calibrate their sensors or camera.</div></div><hr>

Do we need a bill of materials this year? If so, we switched from Tetrix to Actobotics this year do we need to include all of the actobotics pieces into the Bill of Materials<br>
The bill of materials will no longer be required to be filled out by teams prior to inspection. Teams are required to conduct a self-inspection of their Robot using the Robot and Field Inspection sheets located in the Game Manual Part I. Teams should submit the completed inspection forms at tournament check-in or at another designated place.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">11-18-2015, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;T4&gt; states:<br>
<br>
“Wi-Fi Direct® connectivity between the Android devices used as the Robot Controller and the Drivers Station is allowed. No other wireless communication is allowed.”<br>
<br>
Question: is it permissible in the pits to communicate from one's programming Laptop to the Robot Controller using the self-same dedicated Wifi Direct SSID that is already used by one's Drivers Station (technically, this is straightforward to do; the concern here is one of it being allowed).<br>
<br>
If this were not permitted, then one would be forced to use a wired USB connection to download software updates to one's bot. As the game configuration of the robot necessarily lacks this wired connection, prohibition of Wifi direct would be a time consuming and cumbersome complication, as it would necessitate a physical "disconnect, reconnect, download, disconnect, reconnect" cycle on each software update. The need to do this quickly and efficiently would be in tension with most every other design consideration for the placement of the Robot Controller USB connector, which would have the phone and all the attached wiring safely and securely covered and shielded from being able to be snagged from other robots. Moreover, as recommended in the hardware tech forums, it is almost certain that that connector will be physically zip-tied or otherwise tightly secured so as to prevent the disconnection problems many have otherwise seen; this would further complicate and interfere with the ability to change out that connector in order to do a code download.<br>
<br>
Finally, prohibition of wireless communication between laptop and Robot Controller would completely disable the ability to use the Android Studio debugger and other tools to monitor robot behavior while on the field, which would be a very significant degradation in capabilities programmers have to debug their programs.<br>
<br>
We well understand concerns about the introduction of additional wireless frequency use in a competition venue. But as this merely makes additional use of the channel that already exists between Robot Controller and Driver Station, those concerns do not seem to apply here. Permission to use the existing Wifi Direct channel seems to introduce little if any problems and has several benefits.<br>
<br>
Yes, teams are allowed to establish a direct connection between their laptop and the Robot Controller (Wi-Fi Direct Group owner) but only during practice.  When a team is in the Competition Area, the only allowed connection is the Wi-Fi Direct connection between the Robot Controller and the Driver Station.</div></div><hr>

The manual states no live bands in the pit or audience. I am wondering if it is permissible to have the school pep band play the National Anthem and possibly the school fight song from center stage once, immediately prior to the start of matches. It would not interfere with announcements and would actually help focus attention on the start of formal competition.<br>
<br>
Hello team FTC6025,<br>
<br>
An event organizer may invite a pep band to play the National Anthem at an event. A pep band would probably not be invited to play a school fight song (there are many schools at an event, and to highlight one team only is not fair or equitable). If a pep band were to arrive, uninvited, they would probably not be permitted to play.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">12-17-2015, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our robotics program hosted a Qualifying Tournament this weekend.  As we were taking down the fields after the event we noticed that the blue and red panels on the lower levels of the Mountains had streaks and deposits of plastic and rubber from robot wheels, and the aluminum Churro bars had nicks and scratches from contact with robot chassis and mechanisms.  Are there guidelines for what condition the field elements should be in for the start of the next tournament?  Should we remove the rubber and plastic deposits with a solvent such as Goo Gone or ammonia, and use sandpaper or a fine file to smooth rough or jagged spots on the Churros?  Or should the Mountain surfaces be allowed to degrade over the course of the season as part of the game challenge?  Additionally, given that our region will have 10 Qualifying Tournaments this season and by the last one the Mountains will otherwise be pretty beaten up, would it be appropriate at mid-season to take apart the Mountains and turn the colored panels over to expose the unused side?<br>
<br>
Marks on the field or nicks in the churros do not affect a teams ability to play the game. Partners may choose to clean the ramps at their discretion, and we have found that rubbing alcohol effectively cleans tire marks from the ramp.</div></div><hr>

"7.2 FTC Award Eligibility<br>
To ensure fairness to all Teams and to provide equal opportunity for all Teams to win an award at an FTC Championship tournament, Teams are only eligible to win an award at the first three Championship tournaments that they attend in a season. Those Teams who compete in more than three Qualifying Tournament, League Championships, and Championship tournaments do so for the purpose of being involved in the fun and excitement of the tournament and not with the intention of winning awards or advancing to the next tournament level."<br>

Thank you for your question.<br>
<br>
After the third Qualifying Tournament, a team can compete (if there is capacity in the region), but the team would not be eligible for consideration for any award. The team is not eligible to advance to the next level event. Teams are allowed to participate in the finals, but they will not advance from them. In this instance, the team is required to notify the even host that they are not eligible for advancement. The advancement opportunity would be given to the next eligible team, according to the published Advancement Criteria.</div></div><hr>

We were wondering if this was possible as long as the selection is made during the init phase and while the teams are still setting their robots, etc?  For example, we would put the robot down, press init on the drivers station, and then select certain parameters for the code operation - which alliance we are on, start position, etc.  <br>
<br>
This would be similar to previous years where we would initialize the NXT, and make selections on the NXT screen based on our start position, etc.  <br>

Please see Rule &lt;T7&gt; - Only three Team representatives are permitted in the Competition Area; two (2) student drivers, and one (1) coach who are identified by badges designating ‘driver’ or ‘coach.’ These badges are interchangeable within a Team in between Matches.

<br>
At the event that I attend, teams that play in the elimination round are not permitted to move between the pit area and the field area to make repairs. Is there any limit to what I can bring with me to the playing field area during the elimination round? My team built two large mobile carts that carry our supply of tools and spare parts. We have a mechanism to power a number of batteries when we power the cart. Is this acceptable?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
FIRST has set no requirement or guidelines to allow or disallow additional equipment at the field. Generally, space is the determining factor. It is unlikely that most events would have the space to allow a team to bring two carts to the field. Teams should plan accordingly, and only bring with them the most essential items.</div></div><hr>

Thanks for your question!<br>
<br>
Event organizers may, at their discretion, apply Anti Static spray to their fields, if they're in very dry environments. We've asked event organizers who plan to use Anti Static spray to notify their teams well in advance of their event. We have found that the new robot technology is very resistant to static, and spray seems to be less necessary this season.<br>
<br>
There are some resources available to teams to help them better protect their robot from any static that might occur - you can find that information here: http://ftcforum.usfirst.org/showthread.php?6128-Electro-Static-Discharge-Mitigation</div></div><hr>

We were wondering if it is legal for a driver to wear a GoPro to record a clear video of the matches. All Wi-Fi and radio connection for it is disabled, and it is solely used to record the matches, and the driver is wearing it on him on his chest. There seems to be no rule specifically allowing or disallowing it, so we are requesting clarification on its legality. Thanks!<br>

GoPro cameras are allowed as long as it does not violate any other rule, most specifically the Tournament Rules outlined in section 4.9 of the Game Manual Part I.</div></div><hr>

AP<br>
Hi Team, <br>
<br>
12:9/358/14 would be decoded as follows:<br>
  R = Ranking in the league = 12th<br>
  QP= Qualifying Points<br>
  RP = Ranking Points<br>
  M = 14 is the number of matches scored in this year's league play<br>

This format of rankings is displayed by the Scoring System when the "Team Rankings" display is selected.</div></div><hr>

Is the max number of displays using the wired LAN 3?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
The scoring system displays can be run using a wireless network. To do so you would need to set up a router, and connect the scoring computer along with a computer in the pit area/audience area to that Wi-Fi network. As long as these computers are connected to that router, you will be able to run the scoring system displays from the main scoring computer. <br>
 <br>
There is no limit on the number of displays the scoring system can run at a time.</div></div><hr>

At our last tournament we discovered that the rescue beacon button height was not at the height we were expecting. This was because our walls are not the correct height. Because of this we had problems pushing the button.<br>
<br>
Can two to three people with official field walls, measure the distance from the field floor to the middle of a rescue beacon button to the nearest 1/8".<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
Team 5073<br>
<br>
Per rule &lt;G23&gt; from the Game Manual Part II: Playing Field and Game Elements will start each Match with tolerances that may vary by as much as +/-1.0 inch (2.5cm). Teams must design their Robots accordingly. <br>
<br>
This applies to the field perimeter walls as well as all game and scoring elements. Teams must remember that there are a few different variations of field perimeters, and this can potentially change the height of the Rescue Beacon button. It is also possible that an event can have one type of field perimeter for the practice fields, and a different perimeter on the competition fields. The following measurements are approximate heights of each field type:<br>
<br>
•	AndyMark Field Perimeter (newest version): 12’ 3/4"<br>
•	IFI Field Perimeter:  11’ 5/8"<br>
•	Logo Loc Field Perimeter: 12’ 3/8"<br>
<br>
Teams should be sure to design their Robot to accommodate for the potential variance in the beacon button height.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Microburst</div><div class="date">03-22-2016, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Part 1 of the Game Manual, the advancement criteria starting at 17 says<br>
<br>
"Highest Ranked Team* not previously advanced until all spaces are filled, beginning with the Winning Division and alternating to the Finalist Division Team of equal rank".<br>
<br>
Can you clarify what that means?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your question!<br>
<br>
The advancements alternate between  divisions. Spot 17 goes to the highest ranked team not already advancing  from the division the Winning Alliance is from. Spot 19 goes to the  highest ranked team not already advancing from the division the Finalist  Alliance is from. Spot 21 goes to the next highest ranked team not already advancing from the division the Winning Alliance is from. Spot 23 goes to the next highest ranked team not already advancing from the division the Finalist Alliance is from. These advancements follow this pattern, alternating between awards, until all spots are filled.<br>
<br>
The "equal rank" statement in the advancement criteria is misleading. It does not mean that advancements happen from one division only until an equal ranking is reached. It does not mean that rankings for both divisions are combined.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps to clarify, and I apologize that the language in our advancement list isn't more clear. We'll work to remedy that in the advancement criteria for future seasons.<br>
<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">03-23-2016, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the elimination rounds of a regional/state championship match, we requested an alliance timeout.  Our request was denied because it was not called "at least two minutes (2:00) prior to their next Match’s starting time."  &lt;T11&gt;<br>
<br>
What is considered the match starting time?  Is there anything an alliance can reference?  Since there is only one timeout allowed, it is critical that the alliance wait to call one to see if repairs cannot be made within the time available.<br>
<br>
This championship was two-divisions, so there were four fields, with a semi-final happening on each field alternately.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, our need for a timeout won't be needed again because our robot is more robust, but you never know!<br>
<br>
FTC Team 5326, The Enterprisers<br>

<br>
Per Rule &lt;T11&gt;, teams are given a guaranteed minimum of 5 min between consecutive matches. That gives a team 3 minutes from the completion of the match to call for a timeout. The timeout would begin two minutes later, i.e. when their match is supposed to start, not from the moment they call for timeout.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildfire</div><div class="date">04-07-2016, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rule &lt;RS03&gt; in the Game Manual Part I states:<br>
<br>
<br>
Does this apply to the SDK version of the FTC Robot Controller application, or simply the language and processes used (e.g., &lt;RS03.a - RS03.c&gt; stating Android Studio, AppInventor and JNI)?<br>
<br>
There isn't any RS03 requirement on the inspection checklists so the intention of this particular rule is not yet clear.  If it's a rule without any validation procedures or checklist item then, arguably, it's not really a rule but more of a guideline.  In the last event while there wasn't a checklist item to check for teams, we did ask the inspectors to CHECK and RECORD the API version number on the inspection checklist.  What we found were teams all over the map!  We had some on 1.5, some on 1.25, a few on 1 and there was at least ONE team that was still on the PRE-RELEASE version!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, given that Super Regionals for some areas are starting in two weeks and 1.6 is still in Beta, if the beta period goes longer than the next few days that might not leave teams enough time to fully test all of their OpModes in the new version, so if the intention of this rule-without-a-validation is to be "must be on most recent SDK version" then I think we need to do a couple of things:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Let all teams know that this is a requirement and they need to be prepared for it<br>
 <br>
 Probably change that requirement to allow the latest update and up to one revision back (e.g., 1.5 and 1.6, once 1.6 is released) <br>
<br>
<br>
At any event, some sort of clarification for us would be greatly appreciated!<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

The intent of &lt;RS03&gt; was not to require all teams at event to upgrade to the most current version of the software.  Instead, the statement "If updates are announced by FIRST later in the season, Teams must install them prior to the time of competition" was intended to provide FIRST with the flexibility to require teams to update their software in the event that a critical fix was needed for the software.  For example, if there were an important safety or security-related fix that was released to address a critical issue with the software, then FIRST could invoke this clause of RS03 and require teams to update their software before a specified date.<br>
<br>
Rule &lt;RS03&gt; does not require that teams upgrade to the newest updates in general.  A mandatory upgrade would only be invoked if FIRST determined that there was a critical software fix that had to be adopted by the teams.<br>
<br>
In general, FIRST recommends that teams have a minimum version of 1.25 (for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps).  FIRST also recommends that the version numbers of the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps match (for example, if a team uses v 1.77 of the Robot Controller software, then the team should also use v1.77 for the Driver Station).  FIRST does not require that teams update to the most currently released software (even though it is often beneficial for teams to update to a more current version of the software).<br>
<br>
Also, teams are permitted to use the beta (pre release) versions of the FTC SDK software and the MIT App Inventor appliance.  Teams should be aware, however, that the beta software is considered pre-release, and that they are using it at their own risk.</div></div><hr>
