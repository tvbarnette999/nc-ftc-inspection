Thank you for your question. You can find the Field Setup Guide located on our website that provides instructions on how to cut the tiles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Our team is experimenting with the image recognition - and we would like to know on what type of paper / cardstock the images will be printed, and whether or not they will be laminated.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much<br />
<br />
FTC 6996 - Oncoming Storm<br />
<br />
The Vision Targets should be printed on 8.5 x 11 white cardstock, which can be found at most local office supply or craft stores. The images specifically indicate that they should not be laminated, as this might increase the reflection off the target and therefore make it more difficult to navigate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we supposed to paint the wooden base of the center vortex black?<br />
<br />
Only Official Events are required to paint the Center Vortex base black. Teams that have purchased their own field for practice can also opt to paint their Center Vortex base black as it will help to seal the base and protect the base from potentially warping over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-01-2016, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that different types of fields have slightly different heights, and newer mats are slightly thicker than older ones, what is the official height of the buttons on the beacons above the mat?  Is it correct that it can be plus or minus one inch from the official height?<br />
<br />
Per rule &lt;G24&gt; from the Game Manual Part 2: Playing Field and Game Elements will start each Match with tolerances that may vary by as much as +/-2.5cm (1.0 inch). Teams must design their Robots accordingly.<br />
<br />
This applies to the field perimeter walls as well as all game and scoring elements. Teams must remember that there are a few different variations of field perimeters, and this can potentially change the height of the Rescue Beacon button. It is also possible that an event can have one type of field perimeter for the practice fields, and a different perimeter on the competition fields. The following measurements are approximate heights of each field type:<br />
<br />
&#8226; AndyMark Field Perimeter (newest version): 12.125&quot;<br />
&#8226; IFI Field Perimeter: 11.5&quot;<br />
&#8226; Logo Loc Field Perimeter: 12.375&quot;<br />
<br />
Teams should be sure to design their Robot to accommodate for the potential variance in the beacon button height.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-07-2016, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The manual says the targets should be printed such that the target &quot;covers the entire page&quot;.  But, the PDF provided on-line has a 1&quot; margin around the edge when printed.  Since the file is uploaded as a PDF, we can't alter the image size.  So, exactly what should be the dimensions of the image not including any margin?<br />
<br />
Also, do we trim the white edge before mounting with white gaffers tape?  Or do we just put the tape on the outside of the printed 8.5&quot;x11&quot;?  Basically, what should be the final dimensions of the mounted image with gaffers tape?  This is important as some locations might have a final outside dimension width of 11&quot; plus 1.5&quot; of tape on either side giving a total of 14&quot;.  Others might trim the margin and use 1&quot; (or less) of tape on each side giving a final dimension of 11&quot; or less.  This variability could significantly affect a robot's performance.<br />
<br />
Step 8-1 in the AndyMark Field Setup Guide directs you to the website where the target images are located. The Target images should be printed as is on 8.5x11” white cardstock, they must not be resized. You do not trim the edges of the Target. When taping the target to the field perimeter it is important to make sure the entire image is visible on the other side. <br />
<br />
Step 8-3 Outlines that the target images should be placed underneath each beacon 1 1/2&quot; from the floor in their appropriate location.<br />
<br />
Step 8-4 refers to print the FIRST Tech Challenge Logo covering the entire page. This way it can be seen by the audience. Also linked through the document is a PDF that you can use instead of downloading the logo image and resizing it to fit the page.</div></div><hr />

The Particles measure 9.5 cm (3.75 inches) in diameter and weigh approximately 56.13 gm (1.98 ounces). These dimensions are noted in the Game Manual Part 2, Section 1.4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-14-2016, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This issue did not come up until we progressed to State, Super-Regionals, and Worlds.  The issue is that stage crews like to point stage lighting from the outside of the field in, which is obvious.  However, many of them were doing it from behind the beacons.  This caused ALL kinds of issues for teams who used color sensors to sense the color of the beacon.  We suggested at several events that they use gaffers tape on the BACK of the beacons to minimize the &quot;wash-out&quot; from the stage lighting.  I am surprised that the field setup guide did not actually mention this, and I really think it should.  Could we please suggest an edit to the set up manual to include covering the backside of the beacons with gaffers tape?  <br />
<br />
I am surprised we are the first to mention this, because it was an issue at any event where spotlights were shining from the behind the beacons. <br />
<br />
Thanks!!!<br />

FTC Team 6981<br />

<br />
Thank you for the suggestion. After doing some research we have determined taping the back of the beacon is not the best solution, as this takes away from the audience view of the action on the field. We have made some recommendations to Affiliate Partners and Event Hosts based on your feedback about beacons getting washed out by production lighting. To mitigate the issue at all levels of events (except for Super Regionals and World), we are recommending that partners please make sure to work with their AV vendors to ensure the beacons are not backlit.<br />
<br />
FIRST will continue to research the best way to mitigate this issue for Super Regionals and the World Championships where there will be a substantial amount of production lighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-29-2016, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey there,<br />
<br />
I just saw this youtube video of a qualifier, and was immediately impressed by the simplicity of the paper boxes to reduce the amount of flex in the perimeter.  However, I'm being told by a head ref in a different qualifier, &quot;The issue of flexing perimeter walls was specifically addressed in the most recent Head Ref conference call (11/14) moderated by FIRST FTC.   Adding anything (for any reason) to the field including the perimeter is strictly prohibited.  In the case where a robot flexes the field or damages the beacon by direct contact could result in a warning then disablement.  This year, the game is more finesse than force.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess my question is two fold: Could you define strictly prohibited? Part 2: Is setting a box of paper behind the perimeter actually adding anything to the field, or could it be interpreted as a common sense move to stabilize a weakness in the newest AM field that allows so much flexion, especially given that this years game purposefully challenges teams to dart back and forth between beacons, claiming or reclaiming them for 2 minutes?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.  I am sure many tournament organizers would appreciate your answer to this.<br />
<br />
Tournament Hosts may use AndyMark, VEX Robotics, and the discontinued LogoLoc playing field perimeter wall kits for official FIRST Tech Challenge tournaments. The perimeter wall kits should be assembled and set up according to the manufacturer&#8217;s specifications. Modification to the playing field walls used at an official tournament must be approved by FIRST. Any item used to brace the field perimeter wall that is not part of the manufacturer&#8217;s playing field wall kit, whether it be a box of paper, weights, etc. is prohibited.<br />
<br />
The AndyMark playing field perimeter walls are designed with two straps that run beneath the foam tile mats to increase the rigidity of the playing field walls. These straps are required to be installed at official tournaments. Similar straps are not required for the VEX Robotics and LogoLoc playing fields because they are not supplied by the manufacturer. Adding straps to the Vex Robotics and LogoLoc fields that are similar to the AndyMark playing field straps is an option that FIRST allows.<br />
<br />
A Note from the Game Design Committee:<br />
<br />
We are hearing reports of teams driving their robots aggressively and repeatedly making very hard contact on the Beacons and the walls adjacent to the Beacons.<br />
<br />
Aggressive contact that causes significant flexing of the walls or moves/dislodges a Beacon will be considered field damage and penalized according to &lt;G15&gt;. Teams should expect to receive warnings and may receive Major Penalties and a Yellow Card for excessive or Chronic aggressive Beacon contacts. <br />
<br />
Partners and/or event hosts should not brace or reinforce the field walls</div></div><hr />

Thanks<br />
<br />
Please see the most recent version of the Field Setup Guide, version 1.3, that has been updated to include instructions and illustrations on how to mount the beacon to the IFI Fields and to the Logo Loc Fields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">11-30-2016, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
<br />
We notice a lot of 'beacon bashing' taking place and the walls flexing as a result of this.   The new Andymark kits have straps under the tiles to help keep the wall in place, but they seem to be rarely used.  We're also not sure if those support straps were part of earlier field perimeter kits.   Can we expect the walls to be strapped together at official events?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">12-14-2016, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I'd like to be able to reuse the printed Vision targets between events in our league. I've heard from another event organizer that I could possibly use clear sheet protectors (https://www.amazon.com/Avery-Economy-Clear-Protectors-75091/dp/B00006IC89/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478401749&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=binder+paper+protector) to protect the targets and prevent them from being destroyed by tape. I read in the Field Setup Guide that lamination is discouraged due to it being reflected. I'm wondering if these clear sheet protectors would also be too reflective, or if it would work.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Protective sheet covers are not allowed on the Vision Targets. It is possible that the protector can add some reflections to the image that might make it harder to identify the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">01-05-2017, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple of beacon questions.  We do not  have access to this year's beacon or to a playing field until closer to the tournament.  We do, however, have last year's beacon.  I have a few questions to help us with our build/programming.  <br />
<br />
1) Is the size of the beacon the same as last year's?  (i.e. is it 12.25 inches from the floor to the button when it is installed on the playing field?)<br />
<br />
2) If not, what is the height above the playing field to the buttons on the beacon?<br />
<br />
3) Is the button placement the same? (about 6 inches outer button edge to outer button edge?)<br />
<br />
4) Is the button style the same? (can it be pushed with a flat surface, not necessarily a finger-type push)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your information!<br />
<br />
A1 and A2: These questions were previously answered in Playing Field Setup – Answer Thread”, post #5.<br />
 <br />
A3: The measurement between the buttons is 5.3”. See AndyMark’s website for the full print of Beacon measurements. http://files.andymark.com/LayoutPrints/am-3416+FTC+16-17+Beacon.PDF<br />
 <br />
A4: The Beacon button is the same as last season. Teams should be careful to design their robot in a way that can interact with the Beacon without causing field damage or flexing of the field perimeter walls. Please also see “Miscellaneous Game Questions – Answer Thread”, post #33.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agent Angela Page</div><div class="date">02-13-2017, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At our last tournament the drivers stands were just upside down storage containers that were about 16&quot; tall. This became an issue as drivers had to kneel down to hit play, they couldn't read any telemetry data while standing up and if there were any connection issues they had to kneel down to work on them. Kneeling down wasn't too big of an issue as not seeing telemetry but in a game that goes so quickly that is just extra time spent not driving. <br />
<br />
Our questions are: 1. Is there any standard or regulation drivers stands that should be used? 2. Should each team be supplied with a drivers stand or can just 1 stand be supplied that the entire alliance shares? 3. Could we bring our own drivers stand to the field like the old ball tubes that were used last year?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
A1: Per the Field Setup Guide, we encourage our Affiliate Partners and Event Directors to use creative solutions that work best for them, while providing some guidelines of what types of stands to avoid.<br />
<br />
A2: There is no rule that states the Affiliate Partner or Event Director to supply separate Drivers Station stands for each team. They can supply either a stand for each team, or if another solution is available, a shared space for both teams on an alliance.<br />
<br />
A3: Teams may not bring their own Driver Station stands to the event; they must use what is already supplied by the Event.<br />
<br />
